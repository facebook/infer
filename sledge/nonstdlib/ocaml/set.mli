(** Sets over ordered types.

   This module implements the set data structure, given a total ordering
   function over the set elements. All operations over sets
   are purely applicative (no side-effects).
   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and is therefore
   reasonably efficient: insertion and membership take time
   logarithmic in the size of the set, for instance.

   The {!Make} functor constructs implementations for any type, given a
   [compare] function.
   For instance:
   {[
     module IntPairs =
       struct
         type t = int * int
         let compare (x0,y0) (x1,y1) =
           match Stdlib.compare x0 x1 with
               0 -> Stdlib.compare y0 y1
             | c -> c
       end

     module PairsSet = Set.Make(IntPairs)

     let m = PairsSet.(empty |> add (2,3) |> add (5,7) |> add (11,13))
   ]}

   This creates a new module [PairsSet], with a new type [PairsSet.t]
   of sets of [int * int].
