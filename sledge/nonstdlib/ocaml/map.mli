(** Association tables over ordered types.

   This module implements applicative association tables, also known as
   finite maps or dictionaries, given a total ordering function
   over the keys.
   All operations over maps are purely applicative (no side-effects).
   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching
   and insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map.

   For instance:
   {[
     module IntPairs =
       struct
         type t = int * int
         let compare (x0,y0) (x1,y1) =
           match Stdlib.compare x0 x1 with
               0 -> Stdlib.compare y0 y1
             | c -> c
       end

     module PairsMap = Map.Make(IntPairs)

     let m = PairsMap.(empty |> add (0,1) "hello" |> add (1,0) "world")
   ]}

   This creates a new module [PairsMap], with a new type ['a PairsMap.t]
   of maps from [int * int] to ['a]. In this example, [m] contains [string]
   values so its type is [string PairsMap.t].
