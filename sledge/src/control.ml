  (** The analyzer, after calling [create], performs a sequence of [add] and
      [pop] operations. Implicitly, each [add] is for an element that is a
      successor of the element that was returned by the last [pop]. This
      module assumes this implicit protocol in order to infer the structure
      of the execution tree, and uses it to assign weights aiming to
      implement fair random sampling of paths.

      Each edge of an execution tree conceptually has a "weight" [1/w]
      (represented by just the denominator [w]) indicating that there is a
      [1] in [w] chance of making the sequence of branching choices leading
      to the edge. An execution tree starts with a single edge to the
      initial control point with weight [1]. For an edge with weight [1/w]
      that has [n] successors, the edge to each of the successors has weight
      [1 / (w * n)].

      The scheduling "frontier" is a set of edges with weights (represented
      as a map from weights to lists of edges) that have been reached but
      not followed.

      Edges are selected from the frontier randomly using the weights to
      simulate fair sampling of paths as follows. Let [{eᵢ}] be a sequence
      of the edges of the frontier in decreasing weight order. The weight of
      edge [eᵢ] is written [wᵢ]. The sum of the weights of the frontier is
      [s = Σᵢ wᵢ]. Now choose a random number [0 ≤ n ≤ s]. This determines
      an edge [eᵣ] where [r] is least such that [Σᵢ₌₀ʳ wᵢ ≥ n].

      The inferred structure of the execution tree is also used to schedule
      the analysis to proceed depth-first where a random successor is chosen
      at each point until no further progress is possible, at which point a
      new path is sampled. Successors are added by the analyzer prior to
      knowing whether they are feasible. For example executing a conditional
      branch results in two [add] operations where the next instruction on
      each is to assume the condition and the negation of the condition. To
      avoid depth-first execution from being thwarted by choosing infeasible
      branches in such cases, a [recent] list is maintained that contains
      the successors of the last popped element. When an element is popped
      from the recent list, it is not known whether or not it is immediately
      infeasible. If it is, the next operation will be another [pop], and
      this is also taken from the [recent] list. If the element was not
      immediately infeasible, the next operation is an [add] (of a
      successor), at which point the recent list is flushed to the
      "frontier". In this way, each [pop] that requests the next branch to
      explore is chosen from the successors of the last control point,
      effecting depth-first exploration. Only when the recent list is empty,
      is an element chosen from the "frontier" of untaken branches. *)
