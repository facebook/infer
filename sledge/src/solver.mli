(** If [infer_frame p xs q] is [Some r], then [p ⊢ ∃xs. q * r]. The
    vocabulary of [r] is the vocabulary of [q] union [xs]. A goal is for [r]
    to be strong enough that for every model of [r], there exists an
    extension of it satisfying [q], such that the combination (with [xs]
    projected out) satisfies [p]. *)
