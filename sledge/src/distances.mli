(** Given a sparse goal trace to follow through a program, compute at each
    basic block an upper bound on the distance to completion of that goal
    trace, and decorate those basic blocks by their respective distances.

    This distance computation is performed using a "tabulation" algorithm,
    building summaries of each procedure that describe the lengths of paths
    through that procedure as well as their effect on progress through the
    goal trace.

    Currently, we only provide a "top down" analysis, which begins from the
    given entrypoint and recursively computes all summaries needed to fully
    analyze the program.

    A bottom-up approach is also possible, by analyzing the procedures
    separately in reverse topological order. This has the advantage that
    summaries are always computed before they need to be applied, but may
    incur additional work by computing unneeded summaries. *)
