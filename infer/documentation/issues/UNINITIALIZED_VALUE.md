The code uses a variable that has not been initialized, leading to unpredictable or unintended results.

Using uninitialized values can lead to undefined behaviors possibly resulting in crashes, security failures and invalid results.

This can easily be fixed by assigning all variables to an initial value when declaring them.

This, for example, in C:

```c
struct coordinates {
  int x;
  int y;
};

void foo() {
  struct coordinates c;
  c.x = 42;
  c.y++; // uninitialized value c.y!

  int z;
  if (z == 0) { // uninitialized value z!
    // something
  }
}
```
