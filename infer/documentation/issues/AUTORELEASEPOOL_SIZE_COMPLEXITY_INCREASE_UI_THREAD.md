\[EXPERIMENTAL\] Infer reports this issue when the ObjC autoreleasepool's complexity of the
procedure increases in degree **and** the procedure runs on the UI (main) thread.

Infer considers a method as running on the UI thread whenever:

- The method, one of its overrides, its class, or an ancestral class, is annotated with `@UiThread`.
- The method, or one of its overrides is annotated with `@OnEvent`, `@OnClick`, etc.
- The method or its callees call a `Litho.ThreadUtils` method such as `assertMainThread`.
