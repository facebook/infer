Infer reports this issue when the execution time complexity of a
program increases in degree: e.g. from constant to linear or from
logarithmic to quadratic. This issue type is only reported in
differential mode: i.e when we are comparing the cost analysis results of
two runs of infer on a file. Check out examples in [here](/docs/next/checker-cost#examples-execution-cost).
