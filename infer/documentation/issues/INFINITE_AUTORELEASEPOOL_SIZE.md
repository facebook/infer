\[EXPERIMENTAL\] This warning indicates that Infer was not able to determine a static upper bound on
the Objective-C's autoreleasepool size in the procedure. This issuee type is similar to [INFINITE_EXECUTION_COST](#infinite_execution_time), with the difference that rather than the execution cost, we account for the size of the Objective-C autoreleasepool size.

By default, this issue type is disabled.
