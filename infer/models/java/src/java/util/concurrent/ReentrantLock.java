/* Reentrant Lock model
* This is a partial model. Several methods such as getowner(),  hasQueueThread(),
* getQueueLength() are not modelled.
* A reentrant lock is one where if you try to lock() a lock already held by
* the current thread, you succeed and continue. In a non-reentrant lock you could deadlock.
* This is not reflected.  java.util.concurrent ReentrantLocks have some fairness
* guarantees and some things about scheduling
* when the lock is held by another thread, not considered here..
