The purpose of this directory is to test whether DoliToTextual creates
the approptiate function descriptions. We wanr to see that the call of
      infer --capture-doli someFile.doli
indeed runs static analysis on the contents of the file someFile.doli.

We would like that compilation of the files called *OK.doli should succeed,
and compilation of the files *Err*doli should fail. This is currently
sometimes, but not always the case, bacause the current implementation
of DoliToTextual isnincompete.
