The purpose of this directory is to test that doli-defined functions called within textual
files are recognized and their summaries are used correctly at the point of call.

The following experiments demonstrate the status of things:

1) callingExternals_ret_null_TD.sil  (analysed together with the fles external_ret_null_t.sil, external_ret_null_d.doli)
The return value of the external function is a pointer.
This experiment demonstrates that
    a) several sil and doli files may be analysed together


2) callingExternals_Several.sil  (analysed together with the fles missingLabelDeclErr.doli, callingExternals_Several.sil, external_Others.sil, externals_Some.doli)
The return value of the external function is an int.
This experiment demonstrates that
    a) several sil and doli files may be analysed together
    b) the analysis of a textual function may take into account more than one doli definition
    c) the summaries of the doli functions may be parametric with the input provided

3) callingInternals.doli
This demontrates that one doli rule knows nothing about doli-defined functions in other rules.

4) callingTextualFromDoli.doli (analysed together with the file external_ret_this.sil)
This demonstrates that doli rules know nothing about textual functions.
