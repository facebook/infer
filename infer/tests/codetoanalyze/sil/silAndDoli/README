The purpose of this directory is to test that we can use doli instructions in textual files.

When D42193883 is completed, callingEternals.sil will be using the function defibed
in exrernal.doli. Currently, it uses the sil-version, in external.sil

When D42193883 is completed, we will delete external.sil and only use external.doli.
We will probably also need to modify the Makefile, so that it also parses external.doli
