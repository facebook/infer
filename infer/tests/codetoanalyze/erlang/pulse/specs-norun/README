The tests in this directory are for issues of type BAD_RETURN. Unlike other
issues we emit, these do *not* correspond to a crash at runtime. Instead, they
signal a disagreement between code and specs. (At runtime there is no crash
because at runtime specs are completely ignored by Erlang.)

Because a disagreement with the compiler is expected, this directory should not
be included in the compiler tests (see `../../compiler/Makefile`).
