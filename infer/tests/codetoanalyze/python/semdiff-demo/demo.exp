 Semdiff Configuration Demo
======================================

--- Scenario 1: ignore() — Ignoring import changes ---
  with config (ignore imports)                       => equal
  without rules (empty config)                       => different

--- Scenario 2: rewrite() — Assign ≡ AnnAssign ---
  with config (rewrite + accept)                     => equal
  without rules (empty config)                       => different

--- Scenario 3: accept() with key — Adding annotations ---
  with config (accept in annotation positions)       => equal
  without rules (empty config)                       => different

--- Scenario 4: accept() with condition — Rejecting Any ---
  with condition (reject Any annotation)             => different
  without condition (accept all annotations)         => equal

--- Scenario 5: Full config — Combined changes ---
  with full config                                   => equal
  without rules (empty config)                       => different

--- Scenario 6: Catching real semantic changes ---
  with full config (catches real change)             => different
