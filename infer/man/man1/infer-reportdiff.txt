NAME
       infer-reportdiff - compute the differences between two infer reports

SYNOPSIS
       infer reportdiff --report-current file --report-previous file [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Given two infer reports previous and current, compute the following
       three reports and store them inside the "differential/" subdirectory
       of the results directory:
       - introduced.json contains the issues found in current but not
       previous;
       - fixed.json contains the issues found in previous but not current;
       - preexisting.json contains the issues found in both previous and
       current.

       All three files follow the same format as normal infer reports.

OPTIONS
       --config-impact-current path
           Config impact report of the latest revision

       --config-impact-max-callees-to-print int
           Specify the maximum number of unchecked callees to print in the
           config impact checker

       --config-impact-previous path
           Config impact report of the base revision to use for comparison

       --costs-current path
           Costs report of the latest revision

       --costs-previous path
           Costs report of the base revision to use for comparison

       --debug,-g
           Activates: Debug mode (also sets --debug-level 2,
           --developer-mode, --print-buckets, --print-types,
           --reports-include-ml-loc, --no-only-cheap-debug, --trace-error,
           --write-html) (Conversely: --no-debug | -G)

       --debug-level level
           Debug level (sets --bo-debug level, --debug-level-analysis level,
           --debug-level-capture level):
             - 0: only basic debugging enabled
             - 1: verbose debugging enabled
             - 2: very verbose debugging enabled

       --debug-level-analysis int
           Debug level for the analysis. See --debug-level for accepted
           values.

       --debug-level-capture int
           Debug level for the capture. See --debug-level for accepted
           values.

       --debug-level-report int
           Debug level for the report. See --debug-level for accepted values.

       --no-deduplicate
           Deactivates: Apply issue-specific deduplication during analysis
           and/or reporting. (Conversely: --deduplicate)

       --file-renamings path
           JSON with a list of file renamings to use while computing
           differential reports

       --help
           Show this manual

       --help-format { auto | groff | pager | plain }
           Show this help in the specified format. auto sets the format to
           plain if the environment variable TERM is "dumb" or undefined, and
           to pager otherwise.

       --help-full
           Show this manual with all internal options in the INTERNAL OPTIONS
           section

       --report-current path
           report of the latest revision

       --report-previous path
           Report of the base revision to use for comparison

       --no-skip-duplicated-types
           Deactivates: Skip fixed-then-introduced duplicated types while
           computing differential reports (Conversely:
           --skip-duplicated-types)

       --stats-dir-current path
           The infer-out/stats from the current run. Together with
           --stats-dir-previous, make infer reportdiff compute the difference
           between two stats directories and output the results in
           infer-out/differential/stats_*.json files.

       --stats-dir-previous path
           The infer-out/stats from a previous run. See --stats-dir-current.
