                   "paths": [ "isolated/" ]
                 },
                 "sinks": {

                 }
               }
             }
           
           This will cause us to create a new ISOLATED_REACHING_CONNECT
           issue for every function whose source path starts with "isolated/"
           that may reach the function named "connect", ignoring paths that
           go through a symbol matching the OCaml regexp ".*::Trusted::.*".

           substitution

       --liveness-dangerous-classes json
           Specify classes where the destructor should be ignored when
           computing liveness. In other words, assignement to variables of
           these types (or common wrappers around these types such as
           unique_ptr<type>) will count as dead stores when the variables are
           not read explicitly by the program.

           { "sources" : ["Source1", "Source2"], "sink" : "Sink1" }

       --external-java-packages +prefix
           Specify a list of Java package prefixes for external Java

           The version of Java being used. Set it to your Java version if mvn
           is failing.
PULSE CHECKER OPTIONS

       --pulse-inline-global-init-func-pointer
           Activates: Inline the initializer of global variables that are of
           type function pointer in Pulse. (Conversely:

           function. This should only be needed if the code of the wrapper is
           not visible to infer or if Pulse somehow doesn't understand it
           (e.g. the call is dispatched to global function pointers).

       --pulse-model-malloc-pattern string

       --no-pulse-nullsafe-report-npe
           Deactivates: Report null dereference issues on files marked
           @Nullsafe. (Conversely: --pulse-nullsafe-report-npe)

           Maximum number of array elements and structure fields to keep
           track of for a given address.

       --pulse-report-ignore-unknown-java-methods-patterns +string
           On Java, do not report issues that are found on program paths that
           contain calls to unknown methods (those without implementation)
           unless a) this option isn't passed at all (the default, or with
           --pulse-report-ignore-unknown-java-methods-patterns-reset), or b)
           all the unknown method names match one of the provided patterns.

       --pulse-skip-procedures regex
           Regex of procedures that should not be analyzed by Pulse.

       --pulse-taint-config +path
           Path to a taint analysis configuration file or a directory
           containing such files. This file can define --pulse-taint-sources,
           --pulse-taint-sanitizers, --pulse-taint-propagators,
           --pulse-taint-sinks, --pulse-taint-policies, and
           --pulse-taint-data-flow-kinds.           If a path to a directory is given then the configuration files
           must have the `.json` extension. Any other file will be ignored.
           The subdirectories will be explored and must follow the same
           convention.

       --pulse-taint-data-flow-kinds json
           Specify which taint kinds should be used for data flow reporting
           only. If a source has such a kind, only data flows to sinks which
           originate at the source will be reported. If a sink has such a
           kind, only sensitive data flows to the sink will be reported.

       --pulse-taint-policies json
           A description of which taint flows should be reported, following
           this JSON format:             { "short_description": "<a short description of the issue>",
               "taint_flows": [{ "source_kinds": [<kinds>],
                                 "sink_kinds": [<kinds>],
                                 "sanitizer_kinds": [<kinds>] }]
             }
           where <kinds> are specified in taint source/sanitizer/sink
           matchers (see --pulse-taint-sources). The field "sanitizer_kinds"
           is optional (assumed to be empty), and a single policy can specify
           several taint flows using a list. The following policy is always
           enabled:
           { "short_description": "...",
             "taint_flows": [{ "source_kinds": ["Simple"],
                               "sink_kinds": ["Simple"],
                               "sanitizer_kinds": ["Simple"] }]
           }

       --pulse-taint-propagators json
           Quick way to specify simple propagators as a JSON objects. See
           --pulse-taint-sources for the fields format documentation.

       --pulse-taint-sanitizers json
           Quick way to specify simple sanitizers as a JSON objects. See
           --pulse-taint-sources for the fields format documentation.

       --pulse-taint-sinks json
           Quick way to specify simple sinks as a JSON objects. See
           --pulse-taint-sources for the fields format documentation.

       --pulse-taint-sources json
           Together with --pulse-taint-sanitizers, --pulse-taint-sinks,
           --pulse-taint-policies, and --pulse-taint-data-flow-kinds, specify
           taint properties. The JSON format of sources also applies to sinks
           and sanitizers. It consists of a list of objects, each with one of
           the following combinations of fields to identify relevant
           procedures:             - "procedure": match a substring of the procedure name
             - "procedure_regex": as above, but match using an OCaml regex
             - "class_names" and "method_names":
                 match exact uses of methods of particular classes
             - "overrides_of_class_with_annotation":
                 match all procedures defined in classes which inherit
                 from a superclass with the specified annotation
             - "allocation": (for taint sources only)
                 match allocations of the exact class name supplied
           
             Each object can also optionally specify:
             - "kinds": the kinds of taint, used in --pulse-taint-policies
                 to specify flows between sources/sanitizers/sinks
                 ("Simple" by default).
             - "taint_target":
                 where the taint should be applied in the procedure.
                 - "ReturnValue": (default for taint sources and
           propagators)
                 - "AllArguments": (default for taint sanitizers and sinks)
                 - ["ArgumentPositions", [<int list>]]:
                     argument positions given by index (zero-indexed)
                 - ["AllArgumentsButPositions", [<int list>]]:
                     all arguments except given indices (zero-indexed)
                 - ["ArgumentsMatchingTypes", [<type list>]]:
                     arguments with types containing supplied strings
                 - ["Fields", [<(string * taint_target) list>]]:
                     fields given by name in return value, arguments or
           other fields
               N.B. for methods, index 0 is this/self.
             - "match_objc_blocks": boolean, "false" by default
                 "true" if only Objective-C blocks should be matched.

           Specify custom sanitizers for Quandary

       --quandary-sinks json
           Specify custom sinks for Quandary

           annotated as @ThreadSafe. (Conversely:
           --no-racerd-always-report-java)

       --racerd-guardedby
           Activates: Check @GuardedBy annotations with RacerD (Conversely:

       --threadsafe-aliases json
           Specify custom annotations that should be considered aliases of
           @ThreadSafe
SIMPLE LINEAGE OPTIONS
       --no-simple-lineage-dedup
           Deactivates: In JSON output, attempt to print each entity at most
           once. This is the default. The only reason you may want to turn
           this off is to make hash collisions more visible; that is, cases
           in which distinct entities get assigned the same ID. (Conversely:
           --simple-lineage-dedup)

       --simple-lineage-field-depth int
           [EXPERIMENTAL] Maximal field depth sensitivity for lineage
           analysis. 0 will make the analysis field insensitive.

       --simple-lineage-field-width int
           [EXPERIMENTAL] Maximal width of structures for field sensitive
           lineage analysis. Structure that have a higher number of fields
           will be smashed into a single element. 0 will make the analysis
           field insensitive. If not set, field width will be unlimited.

       --simple-lineage-include-builtins
           Activates: Include call/return edges to/from procedures that model
           primitive Erlang operations, such as constructing a list.
           (Conversely: --no-simple-lineage-include-builtins)

       --simple-lineage-json-report
           Activates: Enable simple lineage report in JSON format.
           (Conversely: --no-simple-lineage-json-report)

       --simple-lineage-keep-temporaries
           Activates: Normally, lineage summaries do not mention temporary
           variables introduced while compiling the high-level code to
           Infer's IR (intermediate representation). If this option is
           enabled, then the lineage graph produced corresponds to Infer's
           IR. (Conversely: --no-simple-lineage-keep-temporaries)

       --simple-lineage-max-cfg-size int
           If set, larger CFGs are skipped.

       --simple-lineage-prevent-cycles
           Activates: [EXPERIMENTAL] If set, SimpleLineage will stop
           distinguishing the fields of a variable when it notices recursive
           types (that is, a sub-field having the same type as one of its
           "ancestors"). (Conversely: --no-simple-lineage-prevent-cycles)

       --simple-lineage-seed int
           Set the random seed used for hashing. (Various entities that get
           reported need unique identifiers. To generate these unique
           identifiers, in a distributed way without communication, we use
           hashing. If you are unlucky and get collisions, you can try a
           different seed.
SIOF CHECKER OPTIONS
       --siof-check-iostreams
           Activates: Do not assume that iostreams (cout, cerr, ...) are
           always initialized. The default is to assume they are always
           initialized to avoid false positives. However, if your program
           compiles against a recent libstdc++ then it is safe to turn this
           option on. (Conversely: --no-siof-check-iostreams)

       --siof-safe-methods +string
           Methods that are SIOF-safe; "foo::bar" will match "foo::bar()",
           "foo<int>::bar()", etc. (can be specified multiple times)
