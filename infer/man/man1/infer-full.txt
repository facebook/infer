DESCRIPTION
       Infer is a static analyzer. Given a collection of source files written
       in Java or in languages of the C family, and a command to build them,
       infer produces a list of potential issues.

       Infer consists of a collection of tools referenced in the SEE ALSO
       section of this manual. See their respective manuals for more
       information.

       When run without a subcommand, and if a compilation command is
       specified via the -- option or one of the
       --clang-compilation-database[-escaped] options, then infer behaves as
       infer-run(1). Otherwise, infer behaves as infer-analyze(1).

OPTIONS
       Every infer command accepts the arguments from all the other infer
       commands.

       Options are read from the .inferconfig file, then from the INFER_ARGS
       environment variable, then from the command line. Options in
       INFER_ARGS take precedence over options in .inferconfig, and options
       passed on the command line take precedence over options in INFER_ARGS.
       See the ENVIRONMENT and FILES sections of this manual for more
       information.

       Options can be specified inside an argument file file by passing @file
       as argument. The format is one option per line, and enclosing single '
       and double " quotes are ignored.

       Options without a default value (e.g., --changed-files-index) and
       options with list-like values (e.g., --Xbuck) all have a corresponding
       --option-reset flag that resets their values to nothing or the empty
       list, respectively. For instance, --Xbuck-reset will cancel any
       previous --Xbuck option passed to infer.

       See the manuals of individual infer commands for details about their
       supported options. The following is a list of all the supported
       options (see also --help-full for options reserved for internal use).

       --analysis-schedule-file path
           The file where an analysis schedule is stored. The default is
           infer-out/analysis_dependency_graph
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability
           Activates: annotation-reachability checker: Given pairs of source
           and sink annotations, e.g. `@A` and `@B`, this checker will warn
           whenever some method annotated with `@A` calls, directly or
           indirectly, another method annotated with `@B`. Besides the custom
           pairs, it is also possible to enable some built-in checks, such as
           `@PerformanceCritical` reaching `@Expensive` or `@NoAllocation`
           reaching `new`. See flags starting with
           `--annotation-reachability`. (Conversely:
           --no-annotation-reachability)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --no-annotation-reachability-apply-superclass-annotations

           also on methods that are not overridden from the superclass or
           interface. (Conversely:

           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability-custom-models json
           Specify a map from annotations to lists of regexps to treat
           matching methods as if they had the annotation.
           Example format: {"Annotation": ["com\\.Myclass\\.foo.*"]}
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability-custom-pairs json
           Specify custom sources/sinks, and optionally sanitizers for the
           annotation reachability checker

       --annotation-reachability-expensive
           Activates: check if methods annotated with @PerformanceCritical
           can call expensive methods (annotated @Expensive or modeled, with
           annotation reachability checker) (Conversely:

           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability-minimize-sources
           Activates: do not report paths where a suffix is also a source to
           sink path. For example if there is a source1() -> source2() ->
           sink() path then only source2() -> sink() will be reported.
           (Conversely: --no-annotation-reachability-minimize-sources)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability-no-allocation
           Activates: check if methods annotated with @NoAllocation can
           allocate (with annotation reachability checker) (Conversely:

           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --no-bo-bottom-as-default
           Deactivates: Use bottom as a default value instead of unknown.

           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --bo-context-sensitive-allocsites
           Activates: Assume that different calls to the same function
           creating an allocsite results in different allocsites imported to
           the caller. (Conversely: --no-bo-context-sensitive-allocsites)

           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --bufferoverrun-only
           Activates: Enable bufferoverrun and disable all other checkers
           (Conversely: --no-bufferoverrun-only)

       --capture-block-list json
           Matcher or list of matchers for names of files that should not be
           captured, hence not analyzed either. Clang, Java, and Hack only.
           See also infer-capture(1) and infer-run(1).

       --no-censor-report +issue_type_regex
           For debugging/experimentation only: Specify issues not to be
           censored by --censor-report.
           See also infer-report(1) and infer-run(1).

       --censor-report +string
           Specify a filter for issues to be censored by adding a
           'censored_reason' field in the json report. Infer will not report
           censored issues on the console output and in report.txt, but tools
           that post-process the json report can take them into account. If
           multiple filters are specified, they are applied in the order in
           which they are specified. Each filter is applied to each issue
           detected, and only issues which are accepted by all filters are
           reported. Each filter is of the form:
           `<issue_type_regex>:<filename_regex>:<reason_string>`. The first
           two components are OCaml Str regular expressions, with an optional
           `!` character prefix. If a regex has a `!` prefix, the polarity is
           inverted, and the filter becomes a "block list" instead of a
           "allow list". Each filter is interpreted as an implication: an
           issue matches if it does not match the `issue_type_regex` or if it
           does match the `filename_regex`. The filenames that are tested by
           the regex are relative to the `--project-root` directory. The
           `<reason_string>` is a non-empty string used to explain why the
           issue was filtered.
           See also infer-report(1) and infer-run(1).

       --clang-biniou-file file
           Specify a file containing the AST of the program, in biniou

           --reports-include-ml-loc, --no-only-cheap-debug, --trace-error,
           --write-html) (Conversely: --no-debug | -G)
           See also infer-analyze(1), infer-capture(1), infer-compile(1),
           infer-report(1), infer-reportdiff(1), and infer-run(1).

       --debug-level-analysis int
           Debug level for the analysis. See --debug-level for accepted
           values.
           See also infer-analyze(1), infer-capture(1), infer-compile(1),
           infer-report(1), infer-reportdiff(1), and infer-run(1).

       --debug-level-capture int
           Debug level for the capture. See --debug-level for accepted
           values.
           See also infer-analyze(1), infer-capture(1), infer-compile(1),
           infer-report(1), infer-reportdiff(1), and infer-run(1).

       --debug-level-report int
           Debug level for the report. See --debug-level for accepted values.
           See also infer-analyze(1), infer-capture(1), infer-compile(1),
           infer-report(1), infer-reportdiff(1), and infer-run(1).

       --no-deduplicate
           Deactivates: Apply issue-specific deduplication during analysis
           and/or reporting. (Conversely: --deduplicate)

           --parameter-not-null-checked, --pulse, --racerd, --siof,
           --self-in-block, --starvation (Conversely: --default-checkers)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --dependencies
           Activates: Translate all the dependencies during the capture. The
           classes in the given jar file will be translated. No sources
           needed. (Conversely: --no-dependencies)
           See also infer-capture(1).

       --detach-analysis-dependency
           Activates: Detach analysis dependencies of checkers during the
           analysis, so that each checker triggers themselves only when
           analyzing a callee. This can save unnecessary analyses on the
           situation that NOT all of the captured data should be analyzed,
           e.g. --changed-files-index is given. (Conversely:
           --no-detach-analysis-dependency)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

           See also infer-report(1).

       --disable-issue-type +issue_type
           Do not show reports coming from this type of issue. Each checker
           can report a range of issue types. This option provides
           fine-grained filtering over which types of issue should be
           reported once the checkers have run. In particular, note that
           disabling issue types does not make the corresponding checker not
           run.

           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --enable-issue-type +issue_type
           Show reports coming from this type of issue. By default, all issue
           types are enabled except the ones listed in --disable-issue-type.
           Note that enabling issue types does not make the corresponding
           checker run; see individual checker options to turn them on or
           off.
           See also infer-report(1).

       --erlang-ast-dir dir
           Also load AST from all .json files in the given path. These .json
           files usually come from a previous run with --debug.
           See also infer-capture(1).

       --erlang-check-return
           Activates: Check whether the values returned by functions
           correspond to what the function's spec promises. This check is
           introduced at capture time. (Conversely: --no-erlang-check-return)
           See also infer-capture(1).

       --erlang-list-unfold-depth int
           Unfold Erlang lists up to depth int
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --no-erlang-reliability
           Deactivates: Analyze crashing executions. This flag affects both
           capture and analysis. At capture time, it encodes Erlang specs; at
           (Pulse) analysis time, it models Erlang exceptions (builtin or OTP
           ones). (Conversely: --erlang-reliability)
           See also infer-analyze(1) and infer-capture(1).

       --erlang-skip-compile
           Activates: Skip running compiler (erlc/rebar3), to save time. The
           build command is basically ignored in this case. To be used
           together with --erlang-ast-dir. (Conversely:
           --no-erlang-skip-compile)
           See also infer-capture(1).

       --erlang-with-otp-specs
           Activates: [EXPERIMENTAL] Use type specs from OTP (available in
           the system) to generate more precise Pulse summaries for unknown
           library functions. (Conversely: --no-erlang-with-otp-specs)
           See also infer-capture(1).

       --external-java-packages +prefix
           Specify a list of Java package prefixes for external Java
           packages. If set, the analysis will not report non-actionable
           warnings on those packages.
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --extract-capture-from path
           Provide the path to an infer results directory containing a
           capture database. Together with a list of files provided through
           the obligatory use of --changed-files-index, create a new capture
           database containing only the artefacts related to these files (in
           the location specified with --results-dir).
           See also infer-debug(1).

       --fail-on-issue
           Activates: Exit with error code 2 if Infer found something to
           report (Conversely: --no-fail-on-issue)
           See also infer-run(1).

       --file-renamings path
           JSON with a list of file renamings to use while computing
           differential reports
           See also infer-reportdiff(1).

       --files-to-analyze-index file
           File containing a list of source files where analysis should start
           from. When used, the set of files given to this argument must be a
           subset of that passed to --changed-files-index (which must be
           specified).
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --no-filtering,-F
           Deactivates: Do not show the experimental and block listed issue

       --procedures-filter filter
           With --procedures, only print functions and methods (procedures)
           matching the specified filter. A procedure filter is of the form
           path_pattern:procedure_name. Patterns are interpreted as OCaml Str
           regular expressions. For instance, to keep only methods named
           "foo", one can use the filter ".*:foo", or "foo" for short.

           Regex of methods that should be modelled as wrappers to free(3) in
           Pulse. The pointer to be freed should be the first argument of the
           function. This should only be needed if the code of the wrapper is
           not visible to infer or if Pulse somehow doesn't understand it
           (e.g. the call is dispatched to global function pointers).
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --pulse-model-malloc-pattern string
           Regex of methods that should be modelled as wrappers to malloc(3)

           Pulse. Accepted formats are method or namespace::method
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --pulse-models-for-erlang +path
           Provide custom models for Erlang in JSON files or SQLite3. Files
           must end with `.json` or `.db` respectively. If a path to a
           directory is given then the subdirectories will be explored and
           names must follow the same convention. SQLite3 format is
           preferable when providing a large number of models because they
           will be internally indexed by mfa.
            
            The format for JSON is [SelectorBehavior, ...] where
            SelectorBehavior := {"selector": Selector, "behavior": Behavior}
            Selector := ["MFA", {
              "module": "<module_name>",
              "function": "<function_name>",
              "arity": <arity_int>
            }]
            Behavior := ReturnValue | ArgumentsReturnList
             - ReturnValue models return regardless of the arguments
             - ArgumentsReturnList maps arguments to return values
            ReturnValue := ["ReturnValue", ErlangValue]
            ArgumentsReturnList := 
              ["ArgumentsReturnList", [ArgumentsReturn, ...]]
            ArgumentsReturn :=  {
              "arguments": [ErlangValue, ...],
              "return": ErlangValue
            }
            ErlangValue := ["Atom", "<atom_name>"] 
              | ["IntLit", "<integer_value>"] 
              | ["List", [ErlangValue, ...] 
              | ["Tuple", [ErlangValue, ...] 
              | null
            
            ErlangValue = null is to represent nondeterministic value 
           
            The format for SQLite3 is a DB with schema:
               CREATE TABLE models(
                 "mfa" TEXT,
                 "behavior" TEXT
               );
            - `mfa` is module:function/arity, e.g. "mymod:f/0"
            - `behavior` is a JSON `Behavior` (see above)
           
           See also infer-analyze(1).

           @Nullsafe as a separate NULLPTR_DEREFERENCE_IN_NULLSAFE_CLASS
           issue type. (Conversely:
           --no-pulse-nullsafe-report-npe-as-separate-issue)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --no-pulse-taint-check-history
           Deactivates: Check values histories for taint events before
           reporting a taint issue. This is a temporary flag while the taint
           analysis transitions from being mainly attribute-based to being
           history-based. (Conversely: --pulse-taint-check-history)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --pulse-taint-config +path

           --pulse-taint-data-flow-kinds.
           If a path to a directory is given then the configuration files
           must have the `.json` extension. Any other file will be ignored.
           The subdirectories will be explored and must follow the same
           convention.
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --pulse-taint-data-flow-kinds json
           Specify which taint kinds should be used for data flow reporting
           only. If a source has such a kind, only data flows to sinks which
           originate at the source will be reported. If a sink has such a
           kind, only sensitive data flows to the sink will be reported.
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --pulse-taint-opaque-files +path
           Specify files that should be treated as opaque for taint analysis
           to make sure that procedure's belonging to these files are always
           free of any potential taint flows.
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --pulse-taint-policies json

             }
           where <kinds> are specified in taint source/sanitizer/sink
           matchers (see --pulse-taint-sources). The fields
           "sanitizer_kinds", "exclude_in" and "exclude_matching" are
           optional (assumed to be empty), and a single policy can specify
           several taint flows using a list. The following policy is always
           enabled:
           { "short_description": "...",
             "taint_flows": [{ "source_kinds": ["Simple"],
                               "sink_kinds": ["Simple"],

           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --pulse-taint-short-traces
           Activates: Cut off taint traces as soon as a tainted value flows
           into a sink. This matters when the sink itself calls other sinks
           of the same kind and as long as the value flows from call to call,
           without this flag the trace would include the whole chain of
           calls. (Conversely: --no-pulse-taint-short-traces)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --pulse-taint-sinks json

           --pulse-taint-policies, and --pulse-taint-data-flow-kinds, specify
           taint properties. The JSON format of sources also applies to sinks
           and sanitizers. It consists of a list of objects, each with one of
           the following combinations of fields to identify relevant
           procedures:
           
             - "field_regex": match a field name using an OCaml regex
             - "procedure": match a substring of the procedure name

                 match methods based on separate OCaml regexes for both
           classes and procedure names
             - "class_with_annotation":
                 match all procedures defined in a class annotated with
           specified annotation

       --replay-analysis-schedule
           Activates: Replay the analysis schedule stored in
           --replay-analysis-schedule-file, which should analyze the
           procedures in the same order as the previous analysis. This should
           drastically limit non-determinism in the results, as well as
           prevent repeated work, leading to a faster second analysis. Only

           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --scope-leakage
           Activates: scope-leakage checker: The Java/Kotlin checker takes
           into account a set of "scope" annotations and a must-not-hold

           The infer-out/stats from the current run. Together with
           --stats-dir-previous, make infer reportdiff compute the difference
           between two stats directories and output the results in
           infer-out/differential/stats_*.json files.
           See also infer-reportdiff(1).

       --stats-dir-previous path
           The infer-out/stats from a previous run. See --stats-dir-current.
           See also infer-reportdiff(1).

       --store-analysis-schedule
           Activates: Store the analysis schedule for later replay, honoring
           --replay-analysis-schedule-file if present. This can be useful to
           store a schedule done with one version of infer to load with
           another version of infer. There is no guarantee infer will be able
           to load the previous schedule but using this mechanism gives a
           higher chance of success compared with having to read the previous
           results database successfully as fewer datatypes are involved.
           (Conversely: --no-store-analysis-schedule)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --struct-as-cpp-class
           Activates: Translate C structs as C++ classes. This can be useful
           when analyzing C/C++ code to make sure struct global variables
           shared between C and C++ source files are treated as same
           variables
                (Conversely: --no-struct-as-cpp-class)
           See also infer-capture(1).

       --tenv-json file
           Path to TEnv json file
           See also infer-capture(1).

       --threadsafe-aliases json

           analysing the current function or method, in seconds
           See also infer-analyze(1) and infer-run(1).

       --top-longest-proc-duration-size int
           Number of procedures for which we track longest analysis duration
           info.

           state machines describing temporal properties over multiple
           objects.
           ACTIVATES: pulse (Conversely: --no-topl)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --topl-only
           Activates: Enable topl and disable all other checkers (Conversely:
           --no-topl-only)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

           Print version information in json format and exit
           See also infer-run(1).

       --workspace path
           Specifies the root of the workspace, which is a directory
           containing --project-root. This can be needed if the capture phase
           is expected to require several different project roots, all
           relative to a common workspace. Usually a single project root is
           enough, though.
           See also infer-capture(1).

       --write-html
           Activates: Produce html debug output for the analyses in
           infer-out/captured. This shows the abstract state of all analyses
           at each program point in the source code. Each captured source
           file has its own html page. This HTML file contains the source
           file, and at each line of
           the file there are links to the nodes of the control flow graph
           of Infer's translation of that line of code into its intermediate
           representation (SIL). This way it's possible to see what the
           translation is, and the details of the symbolic execution on each
           node. (Conversely: --no-write-html)
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --write-website path_to_website_dir
           Use to write website files documenting issue types and checkers

           clang targets
           See also infer-capture(1).

           Specify the suffix of Xcode isysroot directory, to avoid absolute
           paths in tests
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --xcpretty
           Activates: Infer will use xcpretty together with xcodebuild to
           analyze an iOS app. xcpretty just needs to be in the path, infer
           command is still just `infer -- <xcodebuild command>`.
           (Conversely: --no-xcpretty)
           See also infer-capture(1).

       --  Stop argument processing, use remaining arguments as a build
           command
           See also infer-capture(1) and infer-run(1).

       --clang-idirafter-to-override-regex dir_OCaml_regex
           Use this option in the uncommon case where the normal compilation
           process overrides the location of internal compiler headers. This
           option should specify regular expression with the path to those
           headers so that infer can use its own clang internal headers
           instead. Concretely, this will replace -idirafter <path matching
           the regex> with -idirafter
           /path/to/infer/facebook-clang-plugins/clang/install/lib/clang/<version>/include.

           equal or great to this value in Gigabytes. Defaults to 8

       --compaction-minimum-interval-s int
           An analysis worker will only trigger compaction if this amount of
           time (in seconds) has elapsed since last compaction. Defaults to

       --config-impact-strict-mode-paths +path_regex
           Enable config impact strict mode only for the given paths. When it
           is empty, i.e. --config-impact-strict-mode-paths is not given, the
           behavior depends on the --config-impact-strict-mode option: if
           --config-impact-strict-mode is not given, it runs as non-strict
           mode; otherwise, it runs as strict mode, but for all paths.

       --config-impact-strict-mode-paths-reset
           Set --config-impact-strict-mode-paths to the empty list.

       --config-impact-test-paths +path_regex

ENVIRONMENT
       Extra arguments may be passed to all infer commands using the
       INFER_ARGS environment variable (see the OPTIONS section). INFER_ARGS
       is expected to contain a string of ^-separated options. For instance,
       calling `INFER_ARGS=--debug^--print-logs infer` is equivalent to
       calling `infer --debug --print-logs`.

       INFERCONFIG: Tells infer where to find the .inferconfig file. (See the
       FILES section)

       If INFER_STRICT_MODE is set to "1", then infer commands will exit with
       an error code in some cases when otherwise a simple warning would be
       emitted on stderr, for instance if a deprecated form of an option is
       used.

FILES
       .inferconfig can be used to store infer options. Its format is that of
       a JSON record, where fields are infer long-form options, without their
       leading "--", and values depend on the type of the option:
       - for switches options, the value is a JSON boolean (true or false,
       without quotes)
       - for non-switches options with no arguments (for instance the
       ...-reset option associated with a list option), the value is null
       - for integers, the value is a JSON integer (without quotes)
       - string options have string values
       - path options have string values, and are interpreted relative to the
       location of the .inferconfig file
       - cumulative options are JSON arrays of the appropriate type

       If an .inferconfig file is specified on the command line with
       --inferconfig-path then Infer will use that. Otherwise, Infer will
       look for an .inferconfig file in the environment variable INFERCONFIG.
       Finally, Infer will first look for an .inferconfig file in the current
       directory, then its parent, etc., stopping at the first .inferconfig
       file found.

       Example:

         {
           "cxx": false,
           "infer-block-list-files-containing": ["@gen","/* no infer */"]
         }
