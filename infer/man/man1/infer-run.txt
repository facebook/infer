NAME
       infer-run - capture source files, analyze, and report

SYNOPSIS
       infer run [options]
       infer [options] -- compile command


DESCRIPTION
       Calling "infer run [options]" is equivalent to performing the
       following sequence of commands:

       infer capture [options]
       infer analyze [options]



OPTIONS
       --censor-report +string
           Specify a filter for issues to be censored by adding a
           'censored_reason' field in the json report. Infer will not report
           censored issues on the console output and in report.txt, but tools
           that post-process the json report can take them into account. If
           multiple filters are specified, they are applied in the order in
           which they are specified. Each filter is applied to each issue
           detected, and only issues which are accepted by all filters are
           reported. Each filter is of the form:
           `<issue_type_regex>:<filename_regex>:<reason_string>`. The first
           two components are OCaml Str regular expressions, with an optional
           `!` character prefix. If a regex has a `!` prefix, the polarity is
           inverted, and the filter becomes a "blacklist" instead of a
           "whitelist". Each filter is interpreted as an implication: an
           issue matches if it does not match the `issue_type_regex` or if it
           does match the `filename_regex`. The filenames that are tested by
           the regex are relative to the `--project-root` directory. The
           `<reason_string>` is a non-empty string used to explain why the
           issue was filtered.

       --debug,-g
           Activates: Debug mode (also sets --debug-level 2,

           Activates: Do not refuse to delete the results directory if it
           doesn't look like an infer results directory. (Conversely:
           --no-force-delete-results-dir)

       --force-integration command
           Proceed as if the first argument after -- was command. Possible
           values: ant, buck, gradle, gradlew, java, javac, cc, clang, gcc,

       --help-format { auto | groff | pager | plain }
           Show this help in the specified format. auto sets the format to

       --specs-shard-depth int
