NAME
       infer-run - capture source files, analyze, and report

SYNOPSIS
       infer run [options]
       infer [options] -- compile command

DESCRIPTION
       Calling "infer run [options]" is equivalent to performing the
       following sequence of commands:

       infer capture [options]
       infer analyze [options]

OPTIONS
       --capture-block-list json
           Matcher or list of matchers for names of files that should not be
           captured, hence not analyzed either. Clang, Java, and Hack only.

       --no-censor-report +issue_type_regex
           For debugging/experimentation only: Specify issues not to be
           censored by --censor-report.

       --censor-report +string
           Specify a filter for issues to be censored by adding a
           'censored_reason' field in the json report. Infer will not report
           censored issues on the console output and in report.txt, but tools
           that post-process the json report can take them into account. If
           multiple filters are specified, they are applied in the order in
           which they are specified. Each filter is applied to each issue
           detected, and only issues which are accepted by all filters are
           reported. Each filter is of the form:
           `<issue_type_regex>:<filename_regex>:<reason_string>`. The first
           two components are OCaml Str regular expressions, with an optional
           `!` character prefix. If a regex has a `!` prefix, the polarity is
           inverted, and the filter becomes a "block list" instead of a
           "allow list". Each filter is interpreted as an implication: an
           issue matches if it does not match the `issue_type_regex` or if it
           does match the `filename_regex`. The filenames that are tested by
           the regex are relative to the `--project-root` directory. The
           `<reason_string>` is a non-empty string used to explain why the
           issue was filtered.

       --debug,-g

       --debug-level level
           Debug level (sets --bo-debug level, --debug-level-analysis level,
           --debug-level-capture level):
             - 0: only basic debugging enabled
             - 1: verbose debugging enabled
             - 2: very verbose debugging enabled
