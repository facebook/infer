DESCRIPTION
       Infer is a static analyzer. Given a collection of source files written
       in Java or in languages of the C family, and a command to build them,
       infer produces a list of potential issues.

       Infer consists of a collection of tools referenced in the SEE ALSO
       section of this manual. See their respective manuals for more
       information.

       When run without a subcommand, and if a compilation command is
       specified via the -- option or one of the
       --clang-compilation-database[-escaped] options, then infer behaves as
       infer-run(1). Otherwise, infer behaves as infer-analyze(1).



OPTIONS
       Every infer command accepts the arguments from all the other infer
       commands.

       Options are read from the .inferconfig file, then from the INFER_ARGS
       environment variable, then from the command line. Options in
       INFER_ARGS take precedence over options in .inferconfig, and options
       passed on the command line take precedence over options in INFER_ARGS.
       See the ENVIRONMENT and FILES sections of this manual for more
       information.

       Options can be specified inside an argument file file by passing @file
       as argument. The format is one option per line, and enclosing single '
       and double " quotes are ignored.

       Options without a default value (e.g., --linter) and options with
       list-like values (e.g., --Xbuck) all have a corresponding
       --option-reset flag that resets their values to nothing or the empty
       list, respectively. For instance, --Xbuck-reset will cancel any
       previous --Xbuck option passed to infer.

       See the manuals of individual infer commands for details about their
       supported options. The following is a list of all the supported
       options (see also --help-full for options reserved for internal use).

       --annotation-reachability
           Activates: checker annotation-reachability: Given a pair of source
           and sink annotation, e.g. `@PerformanceCritical` and `@Expensive`,
           this checker will warn whenever some method annotated with
           `@PerformanceCritical` calls, directly or indirectly, another
           method annotated with `@Expensive` (Conversely:
           --no-annotation-reachability)           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability-custom-pairs json
           Specify custom sources/sink for the annotation reachability
           checker           Example format: for custom annotations
           com.my.annotation.{Source1,Source2,Sink1}
           { "sources" : ["Source1", "Source2"], "sink" : "Sink1" }
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability-cxx json
           Specify annotation reachability analyses to be performed on
           C/C++/ObjC code. Each entry is a JSON object whose key is the
           issue name. "sources" and "sinks" can be specified either by
           symbol (including regexps) or path prefix. "sinks" optionally can
           specify "overrides" (by symbol or path prefix) that block the
           reachability analysis when hit. Example:           {
               "ISOLATED_REACHING_CONNECT": {
                 "doc_url":
           "http:://example.com/issue/doc/optional_link.html",
                 "sources": {
                   "desc": "Code that should not call connect [optional]",
                   "paths": [ "isolated/" ]
                 },
                 "sinks": {
                   "symbols": [ "connect" ],
                   "overrides": { "symbol_regexps": [ ".*::Trusted::.*" ] }
                 }
               }
             }
           
           This will cause us to create a new ISOLATED_REACHING_CONNECT
           issue for every function whose source path starts with "isolated/"
           that may reach the function named "connect", ignoring paths that
           go through a symbol matching the OCaml regexp ".*::Trusted::.*".
           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability-cxx-sources json
           Override sources in all cxx annotation reachability specs with the
           given sources spec           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability-only

       --buck-java
           Activates: Buck integration for Java targets. (Conversely:
           --no-buck-java)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --buck-java-flavor
           Activates: Buck integration for Java which uses the buck flavor
           #infer-java-capture instead of genrules like buck-java.
           (Conversely: --no-buck-java-flavor)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --buck-java-flavor-suppress-config
           Activates: Suppress setting buck config values for the infer
           binary and its version in the buck-java-flavor integration.
           (Conversely: --no-buck-java-flavor-suppress-config)       
    See also infer-capture(1).

       --buck-merge-all-deps

           Use this flag if infer doesn't find any files to analyze after a
           successful capture. Only valid for --buck-clang. (Conversely:
           --no-buck-merge-all-deps)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --buck-targets-blacklist +regex
           Skip capture of buck targets matched by the specified regular
           expression. Only valid for --buck-compilation-database.       
    See also infer-capture(1) and infer-run(1).

       --bufferoverrun
           Activates: checker bufferoverrun: InferBO is a detector for
           out-of-bounds array accesses. (Conversely: --no-bufferoverrun)       
    See also infer-analyze(1).

       --bufferoverrun-only
           Activates: Enable bufferoverrun and disable all other checkers
           (Conversely: --no-bufferoverrun-only)           See also infer-analyze(1).

           Skip capture of files matched by the specified OCaml regular
           expression (only supported by the javac integration for now).       
    See also infer-capture(1) and infer-run(1).

       --censor-report +string
           Specify a filter for issues to be censored by adding a
           'censored_reason' field in the json report. Infer will not report
           censored issues on the console output and in report.txt, but tools
           that post-process the json report can take them into account. If
           multiple filters are specified, they are applied in the order in
           which they are specified. Each filter is applied to each issue
           detected, and only issues which are accepted by all filters are
           reported. Each filter is of the form:
           `<issue_type_regex>:<filename_regex>:<reason_string>`. The first
           two components are OCaml Str regular expressions, with an optional
           `!` character prefix. If a regex has a `!` prefix, the polarity is
           inverted, and the filter becomes a "blacklist" instead of a
           "whitelist". Each filter is interpreted as an implication: an
           issue matches if it does not match the `issue_type_regex` or if it
           does match the `filename_regex`. The filenames that are tested by
           the regex are relative to the `--project-root` directory. The
           `<reason_string>` is a non-empty string used to explain why the
           issue was filtered.           See also infer-report(1) and infer-run(1).

       --changed-files-index file
           Specify the file containing the list of source files from which
           reactive analysis should start. Source files should be specified
           relative to project root or be absolute           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --clang-biniou-file file
           Specify a file containing the AST of the program, in biniou format       
    See also infer-capture(1).

           arrays) is not done element by element but using a builtin
           function that each analysis has to model.           See also infer-analyze(1) and infer-capture(1).

       --compilation-database +path
           File that contain compilation commands (can be specified multiple
           times)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --compilation-database-escaped +path
           File that contain compilation commands where all entries are
           escaped for the shell, eg coming from Xcode (can be specified
           multiple times)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --config-checks-between-markers
           Activates: checker config-checks-between-markers: [EXPERIMENTAL]

       --continue
           Activates: Continue the capture for the reactive analysis,
           increasing the changed files/procedures. (If a procedure was
           changed beforehand, keep the changed marking.) (Conversely:
           --no-continue)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --continue-analysis
           Activates: Continue the analysis after more targets are captured
           by --continue. The other analysis options should be given the same
           before. Not compatible with --reanalyze and
           --incremental-analysis. (Conversely: --no-continue-analysis)

           See also infer-analyze(1), infer-capture(1), infer-compile(1),
           infer-report(1), infer-reportdiff(1), and infer-run(1).

       --debug-level-analysis int
           Debug level for the analysis. See --debug-level for accepted
           values.           See also infer-analyze(1), infer-capture(1), infer-compile(1),
           infer-report(1), infer-reportdiff(1), and infer-run(1).

       --debug-level-capture int
           Debug level for the capture. See --debug-level for accepted
           values.           See also infer-analyze(1), infer-capture(1), infer-compile(1),
           infer-report(1), infer-reportdiff(1), and infer-run(1).

       --disable-issue-type +issue_type
           Do not show reports coming from this type of issue. Each checker
           can report a range of issue types. This option provides
           fine-grained filtering over which types of issue should be
           reported once the checkers have run. In particular, note that
           disabling issue types does not make the corresponding checker not
           run.           Available issue types are as follows:

           analyze an iOS app. xcpretty just needs to be in the path, infer
           command is still just `infer -- <xcodebuild command>`.
           (Conversely: --no-xcpretty)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --  Stop argument processing, use remaining arguments as a build
           command           See also infer-capture(1) and infer-run(1).



ENVIRONMENT
       Extra arguments may be passed to all infer commands using the
       INFER_ARGS environment variable (see the OPTIONS section). INFER_ARGS
       is expected to contain a string of ^-separated options. For instance,
       calling `INFER_ARGS=--debug^--print-logs infer` is equivalent to
       calling `infer --debug --print-logs`.

       INFERCONFIG: Tells infer where to find the .inferconfig file. (See the
       FILES section)

       If INFER_STRICT_MODE is set to "1", then infer commands will exit with
       an error code in some cases when otherwise a simple warning would be
       emitted on stderr, for instance if a deprecated form of an option is
       used.


FILES
       .inferconfig can be used to store infer options. Its format is that of
       a JSON record, where fields are infer long-form options, without their
       leading "--", and values depend on the type of the option:
       - for switches options, the value is a JSON boolean (true or false,
       without quotes)
       - for integers, the value is a JSON integer (without quotes)
       - string options have string values
       - path options have string values, and are interpreted relative to the
       location of the .inferconfig file
       - cumulative options are JSON arrays of the appropriate type

       Infer will look for an .inferconfig file in the current directory,
       then its parent, etc., stopping at the first .inferconfig file found.

       Example:

         {
           "cxx": false,
           "infer-blacklist-files-containing": ["@gen","/* no infer */"]
         }
