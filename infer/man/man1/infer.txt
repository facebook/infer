       infer [options]


DESCRIPTION
       Infer is a static analyzer. Given a collection of source files written
       in Java or in languages of the C family, and a command to build them,
       infer produces a list of potential issues.

       Infer consists of a collection of tools referenced in the SEE ALSO
       section of this manual. See their respective manuals for more
       information.

       When run without a subcommand, and if a compilation command is
       specified via the -- option or one of the
       --clang-compilation-database[-escaped] options, then infer behaves as
       infer-run(1). Otherwise, infer behaves as infer-analyze(1).



OPTIONS
       Every infer command accepts the arguments from all the other infer
       commands.

       Options are read from the .inferconfig file, then from the INFER_ARGS
       environment variable, then from the command line. Options in
       INFER_ARGS take precedence over options in .inferconfig, and options
       passed on the command line take precedence over options in INFER_ARGS.
       See the ENVIRONMENT and FILES sections of this manual for more
       information.

       Options can be specified inside an argument file file by passing @file
       as argument. The format is one option per line, and enclosing single '
       and double " quotes are ignored.

       Options without a default value (e.g., --linter) and options with
       list-like values (e.g., --Xbuck) all have a corresponding
       --option-reset flag that resets their values to nothing or the empty
       list, respectively. For instance, --Xbuck-reset will cancel any
       previous --Xbuck option passed to infer.

       See the manuals of individual infer commands for details about their
       supported options. The following is a list of all the supported
       options (see also --help-full for options reserved for internal use).

       --no-annotation-reachability
           Deactivates: the annotation reachability checker. Given a pair of
           source and sink annotation, e.g. @PerformanceCritical and
           @Expensive, this checker will warn whenever some method annotated
           with @PerformanceCritical calls, directly or indirectly, another
           method annotated with @Expensive (Conversely:
           --annotation-reachability)           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --annotation-reachability-custom-pairs json
           Specify custom sources/sink for the annotation reachability
           checker           Example format: for custom annotations

           (Conversely: --no-compute-analytics)           See also infer-capture(1) and infer-run(1).

       --continue
           Activates: Continue the capture for the reactive analysis,
           increasing the changed files/procedures. (If a procedure was
           changed beforehand, keep the changed marking.) (Conversely:
           --no-continue)           See also infer-analyze(1).

           Specify a script to checkout a previous version of the project to
           compare against, assuming we are on the current version already.       
    See also infer-diff(1).

       --no-cxx
           Deactivates: Analyze C++ methods (Conversely: --cxx)

       --cxx-infer-headers
           Activates: Include C++ header models during compilation. Infer
           swaps some C++ headers for its own in order to get a better model
           of, eg, the standard library. This can sometimes cause compilation
           failures. (Conversely: --no-cxx-infer-headers)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --cxx-scope-guards json
           Specify scope guard classes that can be read only by destructors

           (Conversely: --default-linters)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --dependencies
           Activates: Translate all the dependencies during the capture. The
           classes in the given jar file will be translated. No sources
           needed. (Conversely: --no-dependencies)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --differential-filter-files string
           Specify the file containing the list of source files for which a
           differential report is desired. Source files should be specified
           relative to project root or be absolute           See also infer-report(1).

       --disable-issue-type +issue_type
           Do not show reports coming from this type of issue. Each checker
           can report a range of issue types. This option provides
           fine-grained filtering over which types of issue should be
           reported once the checkers have run. In particular, note that
           disabling issue types does not make the corresponding checker not
           run.            By default, the following issue types are disabled:
           ANALYSIS_STOPS, ARRAY_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_L1, ARRAY_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_L2,
           ARRAY_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_L3, BUFFER_OVERRUN_L4, BUFFER_OVERRUN_L5,
           BUFFER_OVERRUN_U5, CLASS_CAST_EXCEPTION, CONDITION_ALWAYS_FALSE,
           CONDITION_ALWAYS_TRUE, DANGLING_POINTER_DEREFERENCE,
           DIVIDE_BY_ZERO, EXPENSIVE_EXECUTION_TIME_CALL,
           GLOBAL_VARIABLE_INITIALIZED_WITH_FUNCTION_OR_METHOD_CALL,
           INFINITE_EXECUTION_TIME_CALL, NULL_TEST_AFTER_DEREFERENCE,
           RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED, STACK_VARIABLE_ADDRESS_ESCAPE,
           UNARY_MINUS_APPLIED_TO_UNSIGNED_EXPRESSION,
           UNTRUSTED_BUFFER_ACCESS, UNTRUSTED_HEAP_ALLOCATION,
           ZERO_EXECUTION_TIME_CALL.
           
            See also --report-issue-type.
           (default:
           ANALYSIS_STOPS,ARRAY_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_L1,ARRAY_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_L2,ARRAY_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_L3,BUFFER_OVERRUN_L4,BUFFER_OVERRUN_L5,BUFFER_OVERRUN_U5,CLASS_CAST_EXCEPTION,CONDITION_ALWAYS_FALSE,CONDITION_ALWAYS_TRUE,DANGLING_POINTER_DEREFERENCE,DIVIDE_BY_ZERO,EXPENSIVE_EXECUTION_TIME_CALL,GLOBAL_VARIABLE_INITIALIZED_WITH_FUNCTION_OR_METHOD_CALL,INFINITE_EXECUTION_TIME_CALL,NULL_TEST_AFTER_DEREFERENCE,RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED,STACK_VARIABLE_ADDRESS_ESCAPE,UNARY_MINUS_APPLIED_TO_UNSIGNED_EXPRESSION,UNTRUSTED_BUFFER_ACCESS,UNTRUSTED_HEAP_ALLOCATION,ZERO_EXECUTION_TIME_CALL)
           See also infer-report(1).

       --dump-duplicate-symbols
           Activates: Dump all symbols with the same name that are defined in
           more than one file. (Conversely: --no-dump-duplicate-symbols)       
    See also infer-capture(1).

       --enable-issue-type +issue_type
           Show reports coming from this type of issue. By default, all issue
           types are enabled except the ones listed in --disable-issue-type.
           Note that enabling issue types does not make the corresponding
           checker run; see individual checker options to turn them on or
           off.           See also infer-report(1).

       --eradicate
           Activates: the eradicate @Nullable checker for Java annotations
           (Conversely: --no-eradicate)           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --eradicate-only
           Activates: Enable --eradicate and disable all other checkers
           (Conversely: --no-eradicate-only)           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --external-java-packages +prefix
           Specify a list of Java package prefixes for external Java
           packages. If set, the analysis will not report non-actionable
           warnings on those packages.           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --fail-on-issue
           Activates: Exit with error code 2 if Infer found something to
           report (Conversely: --no-fail-on-issue)           See also infer-run(1).

       --file-renamings path
           JSON with a list of file renamings to use while computing
           differential reports           See also infer-reportdiff(1).

       --filter-report +string
           Specify a filter for issues to report. If multiple filters are
           specified, they are applied in the order in which they are
           specified. Each filter is applied to each issue detected, and only
           issues which are accepted by all filters are reported. Each filter
           is of the form:
           `<issue_type_regex>:<filename_regex>:<reason_string>`. The first
           two components are OCaml Str regular expressions, with an optional
           `!` character prefix. If a regex has a `!` prefix, the polarity is
           inverted, and the filter becomes a "blacklist" instead of a
           "whitelist". Each filter is interpreted as an implication: an
           issue matches if it does not match the `issue_type_regex` or if it
           does match the `filename_regex`. The filenames that are tested by
           the regex are relative to the `--project-root` directory. The
           `<reason_string>` is a non-empty string used to explain why the
           issue was filtered.           See also infer-report(1) and infer-run(1).

       --no-filtering,-F
           Deactivates: Do not show the experimental and blacklisted issue
           types (Conversely: --filtering | -f)           See also infer-report(1).

       --flavors
           Activates: Buck integration using Buck flavors (clang only), eg
           `infer --flavors -- buck build //foo:bar#infer` (Conversely:
           --no-flavors)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --force-delete-results-dir
           Activates: Do not refuse to delete the results directory if it
           doesn't look like an infer results directory. (Conversely:
           --no-force-delete-results-dir)           See also infer-capture(1), infer-compile(1), infer-diff(1), and
           infer-run(1).

       --force-integration command
           Proceed as if the first argument after -- was command. Possible
           values: ant, buck, gradle, gradlew, java, javac, cc, clang, gcc,
           clang++, c++, g++, make, configure, cmake, waf, mvn, mvnw,
           ndk-build, xcodebuild.           See also infer-capture(1) and infer-run(1).

       --no-fragment-retains-view
           Deactivates: detects when Android fragments are not explicitly
           nullified before becoming unreabable (Conversely:
           --fragment-retains-view)           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --fragment-retains-view-only
           Activates: Enable --fragment-retains-view and disable all other
           checkers (Conversely: --no-fragment-retains-view-only)       
    See also infer-analyze(1).

       --from-json-report report.json
           Load analysis results from a report file (default is to load the
           results from the specs files generated by the analysis).       
    See also infer-report(1).

       --frontend-tests
           Activates: Save filename.ext.test.dot with the cfg in dotty format
           for frontend tests (also sets --print-types) (Conversely:
           --no-frontend-tests)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --gen-previous-build-command-script shell
           Specify a script that outputs the build command to capture in the
           previous version of the project. The script should output the
           command on stdout. For example "echo make".           See also infer-diff(1).

       --generated-classes path
           Specify where to load the generated class files           See also infer-capture(1).

       --threadsafe-aliases json
           Specify custom annotations that should be considered aliases of
           @ThreadSafe (default: [])           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --no-uninit
           Deactivates: checker for use of uninitialized values (Conversely:
           --uninit)           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --uninit-only
           Activates: Enable --uninit and disable all other checkers
           (Conversely: --no-uninit-only)           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --unsafe-malloc
           Activates: Assume that malloc(3) never returns null. (Conversely:
           --no-unsafe-malloc)           See also infer-analyze(1).

       --version
           Print version information and exit           See also infer-run(1).

       --version-json
           Print version information in json format and exit           See also infer-run(1).

       --Xbuck +string
           Pass values as command-line arguments to invocations of `buck
           build`           See also infer-capture(1).

       --Xbuck-no-inline +string
           Pass values as command-line arguments to invocations of `buck
           build`, don't inline any args starting with '@'           See also infer-capture(1).

       --Xclang +string
           Pass values as command-line arguments to invocations of clang       
    See also infer-capture(1).

       --xcode-developer-dir XCODE_DEVELOPER_DIR
           Specify the path to Xcode developer directory           See also infer-capture(1).

       --xcpretty
           Activates: Infer will use xcpretty together with xcodebuild to
           analyze an iOS app. xcpretty just needs to be in the path, infer
           command is still just `infer -- <xcodebuild command>`.
           (Conversely: --no-xcpretty)           See also infer-capture(1).

       --  Stop argument processing, use remaining arguments as a build
           command           See also infer-capture(1) and infer-run(1).



ENVIRONMENT
       Extra arguments may be passed to all infer commands using the
       INFER_ARGS environment variable (see the OPTIONS section). INFER_ARGS
       is expected to contain a string of ^-separated options. For instance,
       calling `INFER_ARGS=--debug^--print-logs infer` is equivalent to
       calling `infer --debug --print-logs`.

       INFERCONFIG: Tells infer where to find the .inferconfig file. (See the
       FILES section)

       If INFER_STRICT_MODE is set to "1", then infer commands will exit with
       an error code in some cases when otherwise a simple warning would be
       emitted on stderr, for instance if a deprecated form of an option is
       used.


FILES
       .inferconfig can be used to store infer options. Its format is that of
       a JSON record, where fields are infer long-form options, without their
       leading "--", and values depend on the type of the option:
       - for switches options, the value is a JSON boolean (true or false,
       without quotes)
       - for integers, the value is a JSON integer (without quotes)
       - string options have string values
       - path options have string values, and are interpreted relative to the
       location of the .inferconfig file
       - cumulative options are JSON arrays of the appropriate type

       Infer will look for an .inferconfig file in the current directory,
       then its parent, etc., stopping at the first .inferconfig file found.

       Example:

         {
           "cxx": false,
           "infer-blacklist-files-containing": ["@gen","/* no infer */"]
         }
