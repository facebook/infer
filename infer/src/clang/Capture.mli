(** If the command is detected to correspond to a source file, translate it.

    + Given a compilation command, attach our [ASTExporter] clang plugin to the command and run it.
    + Our clang plugin emits the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) as Biniou data that we deserialize. The
      AST format is described in {!module-ATDGenerated.Clang_ast_t} (and its Biniou API is in
      {!module-ATDGenerated.Clang_ast_b}).
    + If enabled, invoke translation to {!module-IR.Sil} via {!module-CFrontend}.
    + If enabled, invoke linters callbacks from [ASTLanguage] (see below). More on linters here:
      {:http://fbinfer.com/docs/linters.html}. *)
