(* This module defines a language to define checkers. These checkers
   are intepreted over the AST of the program. A checker is defined by a
   CTL formula which express a condition saying when the checker should
    report a problem *)
(* Transition labels used for example to switch from decl to stmt *)

type transitions =
  | Body
  (* decl to stmt *)
  | InitExpr
  (* decl to stmt *)
  | Super
  (* decl to decl *)
  | Parameters
  (* decl to decl *)
  | Cond
  | PointerToDecl
  (* stmt to decl *)
  | Protocol  (** decl to decl *)

(* In formulas below prefix
   "E" means "exists a path"
   "A" means "for all path" *)

  | InNode of ALVar.alexp list * t
  | AX of transitions option * t  (** AX phi <=> for all children of the current node phi holds *)
  | EX of transitions option * t
      (** EX phi <=> exist a child of the current node such that phi holds *)
  | AF of transitions option * t
      (** AF phi <=> for all path from the current node there is a descendant where phi holds *)
  | EF of transitions option * t
      (** EF phi <=> there exits a a path from the current node with a descendant where phi hold *)
  | AG of transitions option * t  (** AG phi <=> for all discendant of the current node phi hold *)

(* "set" clauses are used for defining mandatory variables that will be used
   by when reporting issues: eg for defining the condition.

   "desc" clauses are used for defining the error message,
   the suggestion, the severity.

   "let" clauses are used to define temporary formulas which are then
   used to abbreviate the another formula. For example

   let f = a And B

   set formula  = f OR f

   set message = "bla"
