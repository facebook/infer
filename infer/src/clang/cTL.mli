    report a problem *)

(* "set" clauses are used for defining mandatory variables that will be used
   by when reporting issues: eg for defining the condition.

   "desc" clauses are used for defining the error message,
   the suggestion, the severity.

   "let" clauses are used to define temporary formulas which are then
   used to abbreviate the another formula. For example

   let f = a And B

   set formula  = f OR f

   set message = "bla"
