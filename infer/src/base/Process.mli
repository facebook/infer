(** [run_jobs_in_parallel jobs_stack gen_cmd cmd_to_string] runs the jobs in the given stack, by
    spawning the jobs in batches of n, where n is [Config.jobs]. It then waits for all those jobs
    and starts a new batch and so on. [gen_cmd] should return a tuple [(dir_opt, command, args,
    env)] where [dir_opt] is an optional directory to chdir to before executing the process, and
    [command], [args], [env] are the same as for [exec_command]. [cmd_to_string] is used for
    printing information about the job's status. *)
