(** The [mk_*] functions declare command line options, while [parse] parses then according to the
    declared options.

    The arguments of the declaration functions are largely treated uniformly:
    - [long] declares the option [--long]
    - [short] declares the option [-short] as an alias
    - [deprecated] declares the option [-key] as an alias, for each [key] in [deprecated]
    - [default] specifies the default value
    - [default_to_string] is used to document the default value
    - [f] specifies a transformation to be performed on the parsed value before setting the config
      variable
    - [symbols] is an association list sometimes used in place of [f]
    - [parse_mode] declares which parse mode the option is for
    - [in_help] indicates the man pages in which the command should be documented, as generated by
      calling infer with --help. Otherwise it appears only in --help-full.
    - [meta] is a meta-variable naming the parsed value for documentation purposes
    - a documentation string

    or [s] is capital, then the existing prefixes will instead be removed. The default
    value is [false] unless overridden by [~default:true].  The [doc] string will be prefixed with

    order they appeared on the command line. *)

val mk_rest :
  ?parse_mode:parse_mode -> ?in_help:(command * string) list -> string -> string list ref
(** [mk_rest doc] defines a [string list ref] of the command line arguments following ["--"], in the
    reverse order they appeared on the command line.  For example, calling [mk_rest] and parsing
    [exe -opt1 -opt2 -- arg1 arg2] will result in the returned ref containing [arg2; arg1]. *)

val mk_rest_actions :
  ?parse_mode:parse_mode -> ?in_help:(command * string) list -> string -> usage:string
  -> (string -> parse_mode) -> string list ref
(** [mk_rest_actions doc ~usage command_to_parse_mode] defines a [string list ref] of the command
    line arguments following ["--"], in the reverse order they appeared on the command line. [usage]
    is the usage message in case of parse errors or if --help is passed.  For example, calling
    [mk_action] and parsing [exe -opt1 -opt2 -- arg1 arg2] will result in the returned ref
    containing [arg2; arg1].  Additionally, the first arg following ["--"] is passed to
    [command_to_parse_mode] to obtain the parse action that will be used to parse the remaining
    arguments. *)

    command_exe] records information about a command that is used to create its man page. A lot of
    the concepts are taken from man-pages(7).

    - [command_exe] is the name of the command, preferably an executable that selects the command
    - [title] will be the title of the manual
    - [section] will be the section of the manual (the number 7 in man-pages(7))
    - [version] is the version string of the command
    - [date] is the date of the last modification of the manual
    - [short_description] is a one-line description of the command
    - [options] can be either [`Replace blocks], which populates the OPTIONS section with [blocks],
    or [`Prepend blocks], in which case the options from the command are used, prepended by
    [blocks]. If unspecified it defaults to [`Prepend []].
    - All the other [section_name] options correspond to the contents of the section [section_name].
    Some are mandatory and some are not.

    (otherwise the command is considered internal).  [on_unknown_arg] is the action taken on unknown
    anonymous arguments; it is `Reject by default.

    - the command selected by the user on the command line, except if [command] is not None in which
      case it is considered "pre-selected" for the user;
    - a function that prints the usage message and help text then exits with the code passed as
      argument.

    The decoded values of the inferconfig file [config_file], if provided, are parsed, followed by
    the decoded values of the environment variable [args_env_var], followed by [Sys.argv] if
    [parse_mode] is one that should parse command line arguments (this is defined in the
    implementation of this module). Therefore arguments passed on the command line supersede those
    specified in the environment variable, which themselves supersede those passed via the config
    file.

    WARNING: An argument will be interpreted as many times as it appears in all of the config file,
    the environment variable, and the command line. The [args_env_var] is set to the set of options
    parsed in [args_env_var] and on the command line. *)
