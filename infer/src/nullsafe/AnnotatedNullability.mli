(** Nullability of a type in Java program (e.g. in a function or field declaration). It might come
    from explicit annotations (or lack of annotation), or from other sources, including conventions
    about defaults, models, or the mode nullsafe runs in. NOTE: This is complementary to
    {!InferredNullability.t}. {!InferredNullability} contains info about _actual_ nullability (what
    did nullsafe infer according to its flow-sensitive rules.). In contrast, AnnotatedNullability
    represents _formal_ type as it appears in the program code. NOTE: Nullsafe disregards
    user-provided annotations for local types, so annotated nullability applies only for types
    declared at methods and field level. *)

(** See {!Nullability.t} for explanation *)

  | AnnotatedPropagatesNullable

          nullable *)
  | HasPropagatesNullableInParam
      (** If a method has at least one param marked as [@PropagatesNullable], return value is
          automatically nullable *)

          recognizes *)

      (** Infer was run in mode where all not annotated (non local) types are treated as non
          nullable *)

and strict_nonnull_origin =
  | ExplicitNonnullThirdParty
      (** Third party annotated as [@Nonnull] is considered strict. This is a controversial choice
          and might be an unsoundness issue. The reason is practical. The best we can do for third
          party is to register it in third party signature repository. Though this typically
          requires human review, in practice errors are inevitable. On the other hand, if the
          library owner explicitly annotated a function as nonnull, we assume this was made for
          reason. In practice, requiring such methods to be registered in third party folder, will
          introduce user friction but will not significantly increase safety. So our approach here
          is optimistic. If some particular method or library is known to contain wrong [@Nonnull]
          annotations, third party repository is a way to override this. *)

  | StrictMode  (** under strict mode we consider non-null declarations to be trusted *)
  | PrimitiveType  (** Primitive types are non-nullable by language design *)
  | EnumValue
      (** Java enum value are statically initialized with non-nulls according to language semantics *)
  | SyntheticField
      (** Fake field that is not part of user codebase, but rather artifact of codegen/annotation
          processor *)

    explicitly provided trust list and therefore whether its nullability should be refined. *)
