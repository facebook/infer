  (* WARNING: we trade soundness for usability.
     In Java, arrays are initialized with null, so accessing array is nullable until it was initialized.
     However we assume array access is going to always return non-nullable.
     This is because in real life arrays are often initialized straight away.
     We currently don't have a nice way to detect initialization, neither automatical nor manual.
     Hence we make potentially dangerous choice in favor of pragmatism.
