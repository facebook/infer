(** Inheritance rule:

    + Return type for an overridden method is covariant: overridden method is allowed to narrow down
      the return value to a subtype of the one from the base method; this means it is OK to make the
      return value non-null when it was nullable in the base)
    + Parameter type for an overridden method is contravariant. It is OK for a derived method to
      accept nullable in the params even if the base does not accept nullable.

    NOTE: Rule 1) is based on Java covariance rule for the return type. In contrast, rule 2) is
    nullsafe specific as Java does not support type contravariance for method params. *)
