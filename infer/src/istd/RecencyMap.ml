  (** [new_] and [old] together represent the map. Keys may be present in both [old] and [new_], in
      which case bindings in [new_] take precendence.

      The idea is to add to [new_] whenever an element is modified. When the size of [new_] passes
      the limit, throw away [old] and move [new_] to [old] (an O(1) cleanup operation). This way the
      [Config.limit] most recently modified elements will always be in the map, but we may
      temporarily have up to [2*Config.limit] elements in memory.

      Adding elements requires scanning [new_] to possibly remove it, which is [O(Config.limit)].
      This is assumed small (eg, around 50). *)
