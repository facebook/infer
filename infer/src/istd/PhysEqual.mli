(** Helpers function to enforce physical equality.

    Let suppose [construct/deconstruct] is a 1-level-allocation OCaml construction/deconstruction,
    such as variant type, tuple or record construction. Instead of writing

    {[
      let a = deconstruct a0 in
      let b = deconstruct b0 in
      let res = f a b in
      if phys_equal res a then a0 else if phys_equal res b then b0 else construct res
    ]}

    Simply write

    {[ PhysEqual.optim2 ~res:(construct (f a b)) a0 b0 ]} *)

val optim1 : res:'a -> 'a -> 'a

val optim2 : res:'a -> 'a -> 'a -> 'a
