; ## HOWTO generate this file
;
; 1. Build infer without PLATFORM_ENV set and in VERBOSE mode, e.g. `make -C infer/src VERBOSE=1`
; 2. Check the dune logs in infer/_build/log. At the very end is the linking command, which
;    contains linking directives starting with `-l`, e.g.
;
;  '-lCStubs_stubs' '-lzarith' '-lgmp' '-lcamlzip' '-lz' '-lsqlite3_stubs' '-lsqlite3' '-lpthread' '-lparmap_stubs' '-lmtime_clock_stubs' '-lrt' '-lcamlstr' '-lfilename_unix_stubs' '-lsys_unix_stubs' '-lcore_unix_stubs' '-lspawn_stubs' '-lsignal_unix_stubs' '-lerror_checking_mutex_stubs' '-lthreadsnat' '-lpthread' '-lANSITerminal_stubs' '-lcore_stubs' '-lbase_bigstring_stubs' '-lexpect_test_collector_stubs' '-ltime_now_stubs' '-lbin_prot_stubs' '-lunix' '-lbase_stubs' '-lbase_internalhash_types_stubs' '/data/users/jul/opam/4.14.0+flambda/lib/ocaml/libasmrun.a' -lm -ldl
;
;  3. Copy those below as follows: Keep the flags the same until the dynamic section after
;     `-cclib -Wl,-Bdynamic`. The flags already included are for static libraries; we want to keep
;     these the same. Update the dynamic flags by copying all the ones from the log and prefixing
;     each of them with `-cclib`. Beware not to include the libraries already linked statically in
;     the list of dynamically-linked ones either.
;  4. Update the example above to match the new flags so we can refer to it to infer the
;     correspondence log link flags -> this file.
;  5. In the same dune log file you'll see similar link flags for inferCreateTraceViewLinks, repeat
;     step 3 for these and record the new flags in linking-flags-tv.sexp
;
; ## Why this file
;
; We want to statically link some particular libraries into our infer binaries to distribute them
; internally where they might not be available. Other libraries are fine to remain dynamically
; linked.
