(** Domain for thread-type. The main goals are

    - Track code paths that are explicitly on UI/BG thread (via annotations, or assertions).
    - Maintain UI/BG-thread-ness through the call stack (if a caller is of unknown status and callee
      is on UI/BG thread then caller must be on the UI/BG thread too).
    - Traces with "UI-thread" status cannot interleave but all other combinations can.
    - Top is AnyThread, which means that there are executions on both UI and BG threads on this
      method.
    - Bottom is UnknownThread, and used as initial state. *)

(** Abstract address for a lock. There are two notions of equality:

    - Equality for comparing two addresses within the same thread/process/trace. Under this,
      identical globals and identical class objects compare equal. Locks represented by access paths
      rooted at method parameters must have equal access paths to compare equal. Paths rooted at
      locals are ignored.
    - Equality for comparing two addresses in two distinct threads/traces. Globals and class objects
      are compared in the same way, but locks represented by access paths rooted at parameters need
      only have equal access lists (ie [x.f.g == y.f.g]). This allows demonically aliasing
      parameters in *distinct* threads. This relation is used in [may_deadlock]. *)
