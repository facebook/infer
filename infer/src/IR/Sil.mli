      (** Load a value from the heap into an identifier.

          future, so please use [typ] instead. *)

          - [root_typ] is the root type of [exp1]

          The [root_typ] is deprecated: it is broken in C/C++. We are removing [root_typ] in the
          future, so please use [typ] instead. *)
  | Prune of Exp.t * Location.t * bool * if_kind
