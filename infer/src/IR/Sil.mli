    creates a temporary branching in the CFG of the procedure that is closed by a [Join] node
    containing an [EndBranches] instruction. Frontends should try to terminate conditionals (by
    setting the [terminated] flag and emitting an [EndBranches] instruction at the appropriate
    point) whenever possible so some analyses can detect which instructions are executed under the
    influence of a conditional more easily. *)
