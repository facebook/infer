/** Attributes are nary function symbols that are applied to expression arguments in Apred and
    Anpred atomic formulas.  Many operations don't make much sense for nullary predicates, and are
    generally treated as no-ops.  The first argument is treated specially, as the "anchor" of the
    predicate application.  For example, adding or removing an attribute uses the anchor to identify
    the atom to operate on.  Also, abstraction and normalization operations treat the anchor
    specially and maintain more information on it than other arguments.  Therefore when attaching an
    attribute to an expression, that expression should be the first argument, optionally followed by
    additional related expressions. */
