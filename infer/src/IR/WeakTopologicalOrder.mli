(** A hierarchical ordering of a set is a well-parenthesized permutation of its elements without two

    parentheses are called a Component. The first element of a Component is called the head. Let
    denote by H(v) the set of head of the nested components containing v. *)

(** A weak topological ordering (WTO) of a directed graph is a hierarchical ordering of its vertices
    such that for every edge u -> v,

    u < v and v is not in H(u) (forward edge)

    or

    v <= u and v is in H(u) (feedback edge)

    where H(u) is the set of heads of the nested components containing u.

    A WTO of a directed graph is such that the head v of every feedback edge u -> v is the head of a
    component containing its tail u. *)
