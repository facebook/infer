(*
 Anonymous classes have two forms:
 - classic anonymous classes: suffixes in form of $<int>.
 - classes corresponding to lambda-expressions: they are manifested as $Lambda$.
 - two forms above nested inside each other.
 Also non-anonymous (user-defined) name can be nested as well (Class$NestedClass).
 In general case anonymous class name looks something like
 Class$NestedClass$1$17$5$Lambda$_1_2, and we need to return Class$NestedClass *)
