  (** These will be used for traversing "in parallel" the shape information structures, accumulating
      a set of a generic (but static) number of field sequences.

      For instance, searching the possible fields of a single variable will return a set of
      one-sized lists of field sequences. Searching the corresponding fields of two
      (variable+fields) of the same shape will return a set of two-sized lists of field sequences.

      Having the size as part of the type allows both having one generic code (parameterised over
      that size type) being able to perform these two traversals, and statically know at the call
      sites how many field sequences we are accumulating. *)

    The original goal is to be able to use that information in the lineage analysis, by making
    information flow through fields even if they appear in later instructions. The typical use-case
    is when an argument [$argN] of a function is copied into the name [X], and then the function

    (** Given field shapes, a particular shape, a maximal width and three size-indexed lists of
        maximal depths, var shapes (cf. later) and reversed field prefixes, traverses the field
        shapes table and builds in parallel the sequence of field prefixes by recursively adding all
        the defined fieldname of the considered shape to the prefixes.

        The [var_shapes] list is expected to contain the list of the shapes of the variables from
        which the fields [rev_prefixes] are being taken. It will be used to ensure that the result
        will not cross a field table wider than [max_width] even if one of the argument does. For
        instance, the terminal fields of [X#field1], where [X] itself has a huge number of fields,
        will only be [X].

        A shape having more than max_width fields will be considered as "terminal", ie. not having
        any field at all.

        Once every possible subfield has been traversed or the maximal depth has been reached for
        every prefix, the traversal will consider that a "terminal" field has been reached (and the
        folding function will be called). *)
