(** This analysis aims at inferring all the fields that may be accessed from some variable, possibly
    through aliases.

    The original goal is to be able to use that information in the lineage analysis, by making
    information flow through fields even if they appear in later instructions. The typical use-case
    is when an argument [$argN] of a function is copied into the name [X], and then the function
    returns some field [foo] of [X]: we want to know that we should create the Lineage node
    [$argN#foo] at the same time as the node [$argN]. *)
