                  assumption on its value.

                  However, upon calling this procedure, that shape will not be introduced in the
                  caller environment, meaning the caller is free to unify it with the actual shapes
                  used on the actual arguments.

                  Example:

                  {[
                    f(X) -> case foo of foo -> X; bar -> baz end.

                    main() -> Y = f(ok), Y.

                  return) with [baz], the unification will not make it an atom (meaning a map access
                  using [X] as a key would be imprecise, for instance). [f$ret] is still inferred to
                  be the same shape as [X].

                  Within [main], the shape of the argument of [f] is actually known to be the
                  singleton variant [[ok]]. That argument is not introduced as an abstract shape by
                  the call instruction, which allows actually unifying it with a variant at
                  call-time. [Y] will still have the same shape as that argument as mandated by the
                  summary of [f], therefore [Y] will correctly be inferred as the variant [ok]. *)

                        can any of its to-be-discovered fields.

                        If that field is false, then fields that are discovered in the future will
                        be considered as only locally abstract (they cannot be unified with variants

                        iff all seen map accesses use known atoms as keys.

                        Explanation follows.

                        If a vector semantically has at last one key which cannot be statically
                        determined as a constant atom, then we assume that accessing key may access
                        all map-keys of that vector.

                        In that case all the map keys of the vector must have the same shape, that
                        is, all the atom-map-keys that we keep track of. We thus set [map_value] to
                        that unified shape, and all further map-value shapes will be unified to it.

                        That doesn't concern fieldname keys: if a vector-shaped variable can be
                        either a map or a record, then even if the map has complex keys, accessing
                        them won't be related to the fieldnames of the record case. *)

                  Remark 1: integers (and possibly other constants) will currently be represented as

                  Remark 2: if a value can be either an atom or something else, we currently forget

                  that atoms are currently used only for precise map accesses, and we cannot do

    (** Given a summary, a variable path and according to {!ShapeConfig} parameters (max depth, max
        width, prevent cycles), traverses the shape tables and builds the field paths obtained by
        recursively adding all the defined fieldnames of the varpath to the prefixes.

        The traversal building a field path will stop when the maximal search depth has been reached
        (including the length of the argument field path), a shape with more than
        [ShapeConfig.field_width] fields is encountered, or a shape that has already been traversed
        is encountered and [ShapeConfig.prevent_cycles] is true.

        When the building of a field path stops, the folding function [f] will be called on the
        subpath built so far.

        Note that the original argument path depth will be used to stop the search and call [f] when
        {!ShapeConfig.field_depth} has been reached, but no width check will be checked on it and
        its field shapes will not be considered for cycles (see example below). This is why these
        sub_paths are called "candidate" and not the actual sub_paths of the eventual Cells.

        For instance, if [X] has the field [X#foo#bar#baz], the depth limit is 2 and this function
        is called on [X#foo], then [f] will be called with the field path [#bar] -- even if [X#foo]
        and [X#bar] have the same shape, or [X#foo] has a thousand other fields.

        The typical current use-case is to then have [f] call {!finalise}, with [X#foo] in the
        parameters, which will repeat a similar traversal to only yield [X#foo] as a final field
        path (if reaching width limits).

        Note: this is for historical implementation reasons and could be changed now, for instance
        by first traversing the argument path and initialise the cycle set and/or stop early if it
        already exceeds width limit. Note that finalise also processes fields to eg. remove
        {!BoxedValue} and computes [is_abstract] booleans, thus that logic would need to be moved
        here too. *)
