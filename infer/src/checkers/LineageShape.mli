module Cell : sig
  (** Cells correspond to variable fields for which no subfield will be considered by the analysis,
      either because they semantically have none, or because the abstract domain decides that
      considering them would lead to too deep or too wide field structures.

      A field path of a cell:

      - Cannot have a length greater than {!IBase.Config.lineage_field_depth}. For instance, if that
        limit is [2], the only cell under both [X#foo#bar#baz] and [X#foo#bar#ham] will be
        [X#foo#bar].

      - Cannot cross a field whose field table is wider than {!IBase.Config.lineage_field_width}.
        For instance, of the variable [X] has a huge number of fields, the only cell under
        [X#field1] will be [X] itself.

      - Cannot go twice on same-typed fields if {!IBase.Config.lineage_prevent_cycles} is set. For
        instance, if [X] has fields [X#head] and [X#tail], and [X#tail] has the same shape as [X],
        then the cells under [X] will be [X#head] and [X#tail].

      If one of these conditions happens, then the cell field path will be truncated before reaching
      a "scalar" field and the cell will be "abstract".

      To make sure that the aforementioned properties hold, one cannot construct cells directly, but
      should access them through the {!Summary.fold_cells} and {!Summary.fold_cell_pairs} functions.

      The lineage graph is built on cells. *)

  (** Assuming the cell represents a component of the origin variable path, returns the sub-path
      subscriptable from this origin path to reach the cell component.

      If the cell is larger than the origin path (eg. because the origin path is longer than the
      limit and the cells groups it with other paths), returns an empty path. The rationale is that
      the result of this function can be seen as the subpath which, when extracted from the origin,
      will cover all the components of that origin stored in the cell. If the cell is larger than
      the origin then all the components of the origin are in the cell.

      Raises if the cell and the origin path are incompatible (eg. their variables are different).

      Examples assuming a depth limit of 3:

      - origin: X#a ; cell: X#a#b#c ; result : #b#c
      - origin: X#a#b#c ; cell : X#a#b#c ; result : empty

      - origin: X#a#b#c ; cell : X#a#b#d ; result : raises

  (** If a variable path has a shape that corresponds to a statically known set of field labels,
      folds over those field labels.

      Otherwise, calls the [fallback] function on [init].

      If the summary is [None], will always fallback. *)

  val as_field_label_singleton : t option -> VarPath.t -> FieldLabel.t option
  (** If a variable path has the shape that corresponds to a single statically known label, return
      it. *)

  val fold_cells : t option -> VarPath.t -> init:'accum -> f:('accum -> Cell.t -> 'accum) -> 'accum
  (** Folds over all cells under a variable and field path. A field path is "terminal" if its length
      (that includes the prefixed fields given as parameters) is equal to
      {!IBase.Config.lineage_field_depth}, or no more field can be subscripted from its
      corresponding type, or it has strictly more than {!IBase.Config.lineage_field_width} immediate
      subfields.

      The result will not cross any shape whose field table is wider than
      {!IBase.Config.lineage_field_width}, even if one of the parameter does. For instance, if some
      variable [X] has a huge number of fields, the only terminal field of [X#field1] will be [X]
      itself.

      If the summary is [None], [f] will be called once with a var-only abstract cell. *)
