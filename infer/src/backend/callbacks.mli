(** Module to register and invoke checkers' callbacks. *)

(* There are two types of callbacks:
   1) Procedure level callback.
      The checker is responsible for updating checker-specific summary artifacts for that procedure, including
      writing errors that were detected during per-procedure analysis.
   2) File level callback. Guaranteed to be invoked after all procedure-level callbacks for this files are invoked,
      and generated summaries are serialized.
      The checker should return an issue log containing list of additional errors to be added
      to ones produced on procedure-level stage.
      NOTE: The checker SHALL NOT modify summaries at this point, including updating
      summaries' error log.
*)

(** Type of a procedure callback:

    - List of all the procedures the callback will be called on.
    - get_proc_desc to get a proc desc from a proc name
    - Type environment.
    - Procedure for the callback to act on. *)
