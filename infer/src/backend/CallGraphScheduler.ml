(* How it works:

   - the queue [pending] contains the currently-known items of work, which are all the nodes at the
   same height (from the leaves), filled by [fill_queue].

   - when picking up a node to process, flag it so it isn't picked again. Remove it from the graph
   once the work on that node is done in [finished] so the graph gets gradually smaller and the cost
   of walking the graph decreases as we go.

   - to figure out if there is more work, take from the queue; if that's empty then it may be that
   there is no more work, or that we need to get nodes from the next level, so call [fill_queue] to
   check which one is the case.

   - **invariant**: if [is_empty ()] then [next ()] is [None]
*)
