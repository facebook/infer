             given a function and its known block arguments:
             1. if the function is unspecialized then specialize it with the given blocks
             2. if the function is already specialized then get its unspecialized version
                (available as [orig_proc] in the attributes) and apply case 1 with it
           Rather than adding the mechanism to do partial specialization:
             2'. if the function is already specialized then filter-out the arguments that
                 have already been used for its specialization and specialize it with the
                 remaining arguments

             Always applying the full specialization is only valid as long as the new
             specialization work is given at least as much information as the previous one.

             specialization information and, therefore, should be able to ensure the above
