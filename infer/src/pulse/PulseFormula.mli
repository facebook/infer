(** Some types or errors detected by Pulse require that the state be *manifest*, which corresponds
    to the fact that the error can happen in *any reasonable* calling context (see below). If not,
    the error is flagged as *latent* and not reported until it becomes manifest.

    A state is *manifest* when its path condition (here meaning the conjunction of conditions
    encountered in [if] statements, loop conditions, etc., i.e. anything in a {!IR.Sil.Prune} node)
    is either a) empty or b) comprised only of facts of the form [p>0] or [pâ‰ 0] where [p] is known
    to be allocated. The latter condition captures the idea that addresses being valid pointers in
    memory should not deter us from reporting any error that we find on that program path as it is
    somewhat the happy/expected case (also, the fact [p] is allocated already implies [pâ‰ 0]). The
    unhappy/unexpected case here would be to report errors that require a pointer to be invalid or
    null in the precondition; we do not want to report such errors until we see that there exists a
    calling context in which the pointer is indeed invalid or null! But, to reiterate, we do want to
    report errors that only have valid pointers in their precondition. Similarly, ignore conditions
    of the form [xâ‰ y] where [x] and [y] are already different according to the heap (because they
    are separate memory allocations).

    Some equalities might be represented implicitly in the precondition, see the documentation of
    {!PulseArithmetic.is_manifest}. *)
