    given *)

(** was the variable created with [mk_fresh_restricted], i.e. it represents non-negative values
    (hence its domain is {e restricted}) *)

(** was the variable created with [mk_fresh], i.e. it represents any value, positive, negative, or
    zero (hence its domain is {e unrestricted}) *)

module Constants : sig

  (** Get or create an abstract value associated with a constant {!IntLit.t}. The idea is that
      clients will record in the abstract state that the returned [t] is equal to the given integer.
      If the same integer is queried later on then this module will return the same abstract
      variable. *)

(** internal state of the module

    Under the hood a "next fresh" reference counter is maintained to produce fresh [t]. The
    [Constants] module also remembers a mapping from certain constants to their corresponding [t].
    Both of these should be per-procedure only so internal state bookkeeping has to be performed by
    the interprocedural analysis. *)
