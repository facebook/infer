(* Because we use the callee's captured vars' pvars to specialize the callee in the
   caller's context, the pvars might be wrong if the caller has been specialized:
   th callee was created thinking it captured local pvars from the unspecialized caller
   so its captured vars' pvars are linked to the unspecialized caller. However, because
   the caller is now specialized, the local pvars are linked to the specialized caller.
   Hence, we want to relocalize them before trying to do anything with them in the
   caller's context
