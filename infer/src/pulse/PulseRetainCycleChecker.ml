(* A retain cycle is a memory path from an address to itself, following only
   strong references. From that definition, detecting them can be made
   trivial:
   Given an address and a list of adresses seen on the path, if the adress is
   part of the path then it is part of a retain cycle. Otherwise add that
   adress to the path and reiterate for each strongly referenced adresses
   there is from that adress. Explore paths starting from a given address.
   To improve on that simple algorithm, we can keep track of another marker
   to indicate adresses that have already been explored to indicate there
   will not be any retain cycle to be found down that path and skip it.
   This is handled by [check_retain_cycle] which will recursively explore
   paths from a given adress and mark explored adresses in the [checked]
   list. This function is called over a given address.

   When reporting a retain cycle, we want to give the location of its
   creation, therefore we need to remember location of the latest assignement
   in the cycle *)
