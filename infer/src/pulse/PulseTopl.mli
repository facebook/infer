type state [@@deriving compare, equal]

(** This is a subset of [AbductiveDomain.t], which is needed to evolve the topl state. The purpose
    of this type is to avoid a cyclic dependency between [PulseTopl] and [PulseAbductiveDomain], so
    that we can keep them separate. The problem is as follows. A [PulseAbductiveDomain.t] has a
    [PulseTopl.state] as a component. Evolving a [PulseAbductiveDomain.t] must (a) evolve the
    non-topl parts without looking at the topl parts, which is why [PulseTopl.state] is abstract,
    and (b) trigger the evolution of the topl parts, which *should* look at the non-topl parts of
    the abductive domain. Those necessary non-topl parts are what [PulseTopl.pulse_state] contains.*)

  -> state
(** [large_step ~call_location ~callee_proc_name ~substitution pulse_state ~callee_summary state]
    updates [state] according to [callee_summary]. The abstract values in [pulse_state] and [state]
    are in one scope, and those in [callee_summary] in another scope: the [substitution] maps from
    the callee scope to the caller scope. *)

val filter_for_summary : pulse_state -> state -> state

    check to not introduce inconsistent Topl states, but they may become inconsistent because the
    program path condition is updated later.) *)
