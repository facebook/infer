(* - read all the pre, assert validity of addresses and materializes *everything* (to throw stuff
   in the *current* pre as appropriate so that callers of the current procedure will also know
   about the deeper reads)

   - for each actual, write the post for that actual

   - if aliasing is introduced at any time then give up

   questions:

   - what if some preconditions raise lifetime issues but others don't? Have to be careful with
   the noise that this will introduce since we don't care about values. For instance, if the pre
   is for a path where [formal != 0] and we pass [0] then it will be an FP. Maybe the solution is
   to bake in some value analysis. *)
