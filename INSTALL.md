# Install Infer

## Download the Infer repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebook/infer.git
```

To analyse C and Objective-C, Infer requires clang and the
[facebook-clang-plugin](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-clang-plugins). If
you wish to analyse only Java/Android code, then you could skip these
dependencies. Details below.


## MacOS X

### Requirements

- Python 2.7
- [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html#OSX)

#### Requirements for the Java analysis

- Java <= 1.7
- Android dev environment setup for analysis of Android apps.

#### Requirements for the C/Objective-C analysis

- XCode <= 6.3, >= 6.1
- clang (in XCode command line tools. You can install them with the command `xcode-select --install`)

### Installation instructions

Install the OCaml dependencies:

```bash
opam init --comp=4.01.0  # (answer 'y' to the question)
eval `opam config env`
opam install extlib.1.5.4 atdgen.1.6.0 javalib.2.3.1 sawja.1.5.1
```

If you do not require support for the C/Objective-C analysis in Infer,
and only wish to analyse Java files, continue with these
instructions. By the way, Java 1.8 is not supported.

```bash
cd infer
make -C infer java
export PATH=`pwd`/infer/bin:$PATH
```

To compile support for both Java and C/Objective-C, do this instead.

```bash
cd infer
./update-fcp.sh && ../facebook-clang-plugin/clang/setup.sh && ./compile-fcp.sh # go have a coffee :)
make -C infer
export PATH=`pwd`/infer/bin:$PATH
```


## Linux

### Requirements

- Python 2.7

### Installation instructions

These instructions were tested on Linux 64 bits on the following
distributions: Debian 7, Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS.

Install the OCaml dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git openjdk-7-jdk m4 zlib1g-dev python-software-properties build-essential libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev unzip
wget https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/download/1.2.2/opam-1.2.2-x86_64-Linux -O opam
chmod +x opam
./opam init --comp=4.01.0 #(then say 'y' to the final question)
eval `./opam config env`
./opam install extlib.1.5.4 atdgen.1.6.0 javalib.2.3.1 sawja.1.5.1 #(then say 'y' to the question)
```

If you do not require support for the C/Objective-C analysis in Infer,
and only wish to analyse Java files, continue with these
instructions. By the way, Java 1.8 is not supported.

```bash
cd infer
make -C infer java
export PATH=`pwd`/infer/bin:$PATH
```

To compile support for both Java and C/Objective-C, do this
instead. This assumes that gcc >= 4.7.2 is already installed on your
system. If your distribution is Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS, you can install
gcc-4.8 and g++-4.8. Follow the following instructions to do that. You
may skip this step in other distributions with a recent enough version
of gcc, for instance Debian 7.

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8
```

Then continue with:

```bash
cd infer
./update-fcp.sh
../facebook-clang-plugin/clang/setup.sh  # go have a coffee :)
./compile-fcp.sh
make -C infer
export PATH=`pwd`/infer/bin:$PATH
```
