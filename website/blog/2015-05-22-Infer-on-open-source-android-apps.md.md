title: Infer on Open Source Android Apps

We ran Infer on a few open source Android apps with the aim of finding some bugs
and getting them fixed. Some of those reports got indeed fixed.

One of the apps analyzed was the search engine
[DuckDuckGo](https://github.com/duckduckgo/android). We found that many database
cursors were not closed. Soon after we reported the issue, a developer
[fixed it](https://github.com/duckduckgo/android/commit/2c2d79f990dde0e44cdbecb1925b73c63bf9141d).

We also analyzed the popular email client [k-9](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9).
We found a file not closed leak and reported it. Interestingly, a developer
[fixed it](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/commit/d538278be62687758c956af62ee47c53637d67d8)
by not writing some logging info to the file at all. So Infer helped them to
simplify their code.

[Conversations](https://github.com/siacs/Conversations) is an open source
XMPP/Jabber client for Android smart phones. We analyzed it as well and found a
file not closed leak, which was also
[fixed](https://github.com/Flowdalic/MemorizingTrustManager/commit/190c57a9a8385f4726c817924b123438af6adc2f).
