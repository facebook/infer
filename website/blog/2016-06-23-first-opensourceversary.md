title: Open Sourcing Infer, 1 Year On
author: Jules Villard
---

It's been a little over a year ago since we
[open-sourced Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer/commit/b8982270f2423864c236ff8dcdbeb5cd82aa6002)
on 9 June 2016!

The Infer GitHub repo has seen a lot of activity since then:

- 5350 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/infer)
- 339 [issues](https://github.com/facebook/infer/issues) opened
- 44 [pull requests](https://github.com/facebook/infer/pulls) by 15 contributors
- 10 [releases](https://github.com/facebook/infer/releases/)
- 5 external companies officially using Infer (add yourself
  [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/edit/main/website/src/pages/index.js))

Infer was presented at 13 academic and tech international conferences, and at 8
universities around the world!

Amongst these was
[Mobile@Scale](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1566627733629653/mobile-scale-london-recap/)
in March 2016, where we [announced](/blog/2016/03/17/collaboration-with-spotify)
our collaboration with [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/). Around the same
time, [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) presented at
[Droidcon SF](http://sf.droidcon.com/) their
[Rave](https://github.com/uber-common/rave) + Infer combo to
[help their developers move fast](https://speakerdeck.com/lukestclair/frameworks-for-coding-confidence),
and open-sourced a
[Gradle plugin for Infer](https://github.com/uber-common/infer-plugin).

Infer has also been used to introduce static analysis to students in university
courses, including at [UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/),
[Imperial College](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/), and
[Queen Mary University](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/).

In May, [Reason](http://facebook.github.io/reason/) was released publicly and,
simultaneously, Infer became the first ever project to
[use Reason](https://github.com/facebook/infer/commit/885beed0b14e8ef4b6e8a0aa3f4239e60c4e567b)!
Reason is a new syntax for [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/), the programming language
in which Infer is written.
