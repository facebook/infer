## Get Infer

You can use Homebrew (Mac only), our binary releases, build infer from source,
or use our Docker image.

On Mac, the simplest way is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Type this into a
terminal:

```sh
brew install infer
```

On Linux, or if you do not wish to use Homebrew on Mac, use our latest
[binary release](https://github.com/facebook/infer/releases/latest). Download
the tarball then extract it anywhere on your system to start using infer. For
example, this downloads infer in /opt on Linux (replace `VERSION` with the
latest release, eg `VERSION=0.17.0`):

```bash
VERSION=0.XX.Y; \
curl -sSL "https://github.com/facebook/infer/releases/download/v$VERSION/infer-linux64-v$VERSION.tar.xz" \
| sudo tar -C /opt -xJ && \
ln -s "/opt/infer-linux64-v$VERSION/bin/infer" /usr/local/bin/infer
```

If the binaries do not work for you, or if you would rather build infer from
source, follow the
[install from source](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install-infer-from-source)
instructions to install Infer on your system.

Alternatively, use our [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
image:

```bash
wget -O Dockerfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/infer/master/docker/0.14.0/Dockerfile
wget -O run.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/infer/master/docker/0.14.0/run.sh
sh run.sh
```
