title: List of all issue types
---

Here is an overview of the issue types currently reported by Infer.


## ARBITRARY_CODE_EXECUTION_UNDER_LOCK

Reported as "Arbitrary Code Execution Under lock" by [starvation](/docs/checker-starvation).

A call which may execute arbitrary code (such as registered, or chained, callbacks) is made while a lock is held.
This code may deadlock whenever the callbacks obtain locks themselves, so it is an unsafe pattern.
This warning is issued only at the innermost lock acquisition around the final call.

Example:
```java
public class NotUnderLock {
  SettableFuture future = null;

  public void callFutureSetOk() {
    future.set(null);
  }

  public synchronized void firstAcquisitionBad() {
    callFutureSetOk();
  }

  public void secondAcquisitionOk(Object o) {
    synchronized (o) {
      firstAcquisitionBad();
    }
  }
}
```

## ASSIGN_POINTER_WARNING

Reported as "Assign Pointer Warning" by [linters](/docs/checker-linters).

This check fires when a pointer to an Obj-C object is tagged with an `assign`
property (similar to the `-Warc-unsafe-retained-assign` compiler flag). Not
holding a strong reference to the object makes it easy to accidentally create
and use a dangling pointer.

## AUTORELEASEPOOL_SIZE_COMPLEXITY_INCREASE

Reported as "Autoreleasepool Size Complexity Increase" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

\[EXPERIMENTAL\] Infer reports this issue when the ObjC autoreleasepool's size complexity of a
program increases in degree: e.g. from constant to linear or from logarithmic to quadratic. This
issue type is only reported in differential mode: i.e when we are comparing the analysis results of
two runs of infer on a file.

## AUTORELEASEPOOL_SIZE_COMPLEXITY_INCREASE_UI_THREAD

Reported as "Autoreleasepool Size Complexity Increase Ui Thread" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

\[EXPERIMENTAL\] Infer reports this issue when the ObjC autoreleasepool's complexity of the
procedure increases in degree **and** the procedure runs on the UI (main) thread.

Infer considers a method as running on the UI thread whenever:

- The method, one of its overrides, its class, or an ancestral class, is annotated with `@UiThread`.
- The method, or one of its overrides is annotated with `@OnEvent`, `@OnClick`, etc.
- The method or its callees call a `Litho.ThreadUtils` method such as `assertMainThread`.

## AUTORELEASEPOOL_SIZE_UNREACHABLE_AT_EXIT

Reported as "Autoreleasepool Size Unreachable At Exit" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

\[EXPERIMENTAL\] This issue type indicates that the program's execution doesn't reach the exit
node. Hence, we cannot compute a static bound of ObjC autoreleasepool's size for the procedure.

## BAD_POINTER_COMPARISON

Reported as "Bad Pointer Comparison" by [linters](/docs/checker-linters).

Infer reports these warnings in Objective-C when a boxed primitive type such as
`NSNumber *` is coerced to a boolean in a comparison. For example, consider the
code

```objectivec
void foo(NSNumber * n) {
  if (n) ...
```

The branch in the above code will be taken when the pointer `n` is non-`nil`,
but the programmer might have actually wanted the branch to be taken when the
integer pointed to by `n` is nonzero (e.g., she may have meant to call an
accessor like `[n intValue]` instead). Infer will ask the programmer explicitly
compare `n` to `nil` or call an accessor to clarify her intention.

## BIABDUCTION_MEMORY_LEAK

Reported as "Memory Leak" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).

See [MEMORY_LEAK](#memory_leak).
## BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1

Reported as "Buffer Overrun L1" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

Buffer overrun reports fall into several "buckets" corresponding to the expected precision of the
report.  The higher the number, the more likely it is to be a false positive.

*   `L1`: The most faithful report, when it *must* be unsafe.  For example, array size: `[5,5]`,
    offset: `[3,3]`.

*   `L2`: Less faithful report than `L1`, when it *may* be unsafe.  For example, array size:`[5,5]`,
    offset: `[0,5]`.  Note that the offset may be a safe value in the real execution, i.e. 0, 1, 2,
    3, 4.

*   `L5`: The least faithful report, when there is an interval top.  For example, array size:
    `[5,5]`, offset: `[-oo,+oo]`.

*   `L4`: More faithful report than `L5`, when there is an infinity value.  For example, array size:
    `[5,5]`, offset: `[0, +oo]`.

*   `L3`: The reports that are not included in the above cases.

*   `S2`: An array access is unsafe by symbolic values.  For example, array size: `[n,n]`, offset
    `[n,+oo]`.

*   `U5`: An array access is unsafe by unknown values, which are usually from unknown function
    calls.

## BUFFER_OVERRUN_L2

Reported as "Buffer Overrun L2" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

See [BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1](#buffer_overrun_l1)
## BUFFER_OVERRUN_L3

Reported as "Buffer Overrun L3" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

See [BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1](#buffer_overrun_l1)
## BUFFER_OVERRUN_L4

Reported as "Buffer Overrun L4" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

See [BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1](#buffer_overrun_l1)
## BUFFER_OVERRUN_L5

Reported as "Buffer Overrun L5" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

See [BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1](#buffer_overrun_l1)
## BUFFER_OVERRUN_S2

Reported as "Buffer Overrun S2" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

See [BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1](#buffer_overrun_l1)
## BUFFER_OVERRUN_U5

Reported as "Buffer Overrun U5" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

See [BUFFER_OVERRUN_L1](#buffer_overrun_l1)
## CAPTURED_STRONG_SELF

Reported as "Captured strongSelf" by [self-in-block](/docs/checker-self-in-block).

This will happen in one of two cases generally:

1. One uses `weakSelf` but forgot to declare it weak first.
2. One is using `strongSelf`, declared in a block, in another (inside) block.
   This changes the delicate balance of the `weakSelf`/`strongSelf` use in the
   first block. The retain cycle is avoided there because `strongSelf` is a
   local variable to the block. If `strongSelf` is used in the inside block,
   then it's not a local variable anymore, but a captured variable.

## CHECKERS_ALLOCATES_MEMORY

Reported as "Allocates Memory" by [annotation-reachability](/docs/checker-annotation-reachability).

A method annotated with `@NoAllocation` transitively calls `new`.

Example:

```java
class C implements I {
  @NoAllocation
  void directlyAllocatingMethod() {
    new Object();
  }
}
```

## CHECKERS_ANNOTATION_REACHABILITY_ERROR

Reported as "Annotation Reachability Error" by [annotation-reachability](/docs/checker-annotation-reachability).

A method annotated with an annotation `@A` transitively calls a method annotated `@B` where the combination of annotations is forbidden (for example, `@UiThread` calling `@WorkerThread`).

## CHECKERS_CALLS_EXPENSIVE_METHOD

Reported as "Expensive Method Called" by [annotation-reachability](/docs/checker-annotation-reachability).

A method annotated with `@PerformanceCritical` transitively calls a method annotated `@Expensive`.

Example:

```java
class C {
  @PerformanceCritical
  void perfCritical() {
    expensive();
  }

  @Expensive
  void expensive() {}
}
```

## CHECKERS_EXPENSIVE_OVERRIDES_UNANNOTATED

Reported as "Expensive Overrides Unannotated" by [annotation-reachability](/docs/checker-annotation-reachability).

A method annotated with `@Expensive` overrides an un-annotated method.

Example:

```java
interface I {
  void foo();
}

class A implements I {
  @Expensive
  public void foo() {}
}
```

## CHECKERS_FRAGMENT_RETAINS_VIEW

Reported as "Fragment Retains View" by [fragment-retains-view](/docs/checker-fragment-retains-view).

This error type is Android-specific. It fires when a `Fragment` type fails to
nullify one or more of its declared `View` fields in `onDestroyView`. In
performance-sensitive applications, a `Fragment` should initialize all `View`'s
in `onCreateView` and nullify them in `onDestroyView`. If a `Fragment` is placed
on the back stack and fails to nullify a `View` in `onDestroyView`, it will
retain a useless reference to that `View` that will not be cleaned up until the
`Fragment` is resumed or destroyed.

Action: Nullify the `View` in question in `onDestroyView`.

## CHECKERS_IMMUTABLE_CAST

Reported as "Checkers Immutable Cast" by [immutable-cast](/docs/checker-immutable-cast).

This error type is reported in Java. It fires when an immutable collection is
returned from a method whose type is mutable.

```java
  public List<String> getSomeList() {
    ImmutableList<String> l = foo(...);
    return l;
  }
```

This can lead to a runtime error if users of `getSomeList` try to modify the
list e.g. by adding elements.

Action: you can change the return type to be immutable, or make a copy of the
collection so that it can be modified.

## CHECKERS_PRINTF_ARGS

Reported as "Checkers Printf Args" by [printf-args](/docs/checker-printf-args).

This error is reported when the argument types to a `printf` method do not match the format string.

```java
  void stringInsteadOfInteger(PrintStream out) {
    out.printf("Hello %d", "world");
  }
```

Action: fix the mismatch between format string and argument types.

## COMPONENT_WITH_MULTIPLE_FACTORY_METHODS

Reported as "Component With Multiple Factory Methods" by [linters](/docs/checker-linters).


## CONDITION_ALWAYS_FALSE

Reported as "Condition Always False" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

A condition expression is **always** evaluated to false.
## CONDITION_ALWAYS_TRUE

Reported as "Condition Always True" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

A condition expression is **always** evaluated to true.
## CONFIG_CHECKS_BETWEEN_MARKERS

Reported as "Config Checks Between Markers" by [config-checks-between-markers](/docs/checker-config-checks-between-markers).

A config checking is done between a marker's start and end
## CONFIG_IMPACT

Reported as "Config Impact" by [config-impact-analysis](/docs/checker-config-impact-analysis).

A function is called without a config check
## CONSTANT_ADDRESS_DEREFERENCE

Reported as "Constant Address Dereference" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

This is reported when an address obtained via a non-zero constant is
dereferenced. If the address is zero then
[`NULLPTR_DEREFERENCE`](#nullptr_dereference) is reported instead.

For example, `int *p = (int *) 123; *p = 42;` generates this issue
type.

## CREATE_INTENT_FROM_URI

Reported as "Create Intent From Uri" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Create an intent/start a component using a (possibly user-controlled) URI. may or may not be an issue depending on where the URI comes from.
## CROSS_SITE_SCRIPTING

Reported as "Cross Site Scripting" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Untrusted data flows into HTML; XSS risk.
## CXX_REFERENCE_CAPTURED_IN_OBJC_BLOCK

Reported as "Cxx Reference Captured In Objc Block" by [linters](/docs/checker-linters).

With this check, Infer detects C++ references captured in a block. Doing this is
almost always wrong. The reason is that C++ references are not managed pointers
(like ARC pointers) and so the referent is likely to be gone by the time the
block gets executed. One solution is to do a local copy of the reference and
pass that to the block. Example:

```c
(int &) v;
...
const int copied_v = v;
^{
// use copied_v not v
};
```

## DANGLING_POINTER_DEREFERENCE

Reported as "Dangling Pointer Dereference" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).


## DEADLOCK

Reported as "Deadlock" by [starvation](/docs/checker-starvation).

This error is currently reported in Java. A deadlock occurs when two distinct
threads try to acquire two locks in reverse orders. The following code
illustrates a textbook example. Of course, in real deadlocks, the lock
acquisitions may be separated by deeply nested call chains.

```java
  public void lockAThenB() {
    synchronized(lockA) {
      synchronized(lockB) {
       // do something with both resources
      }
    }
  }

  public void lockBThenA() {
    synchronized(lockB) {
      synchronized(lockA) {
       // do something with both resources
      }
    }
  }
```

The standard solution to a deadlock is to fix an order of lock acquisition and
adhere to that order in all cases. Another solution may be to shrink the
critical sections (i.e., the code executing under lock) to the minimum required.

Old-style containers such as `Vector` are synchronized on the object monitor,
which means that deadlocks can occur even without explicit synchronisation on
both threads. For instance:

```java
  public void lockAThenAddToVector() {
    synchronized(lockA) {
      vector.add(object);
    }
  }

  public void lockVectorThenA() {
    synchronized(vector) {
      synchronized(lockA) {
       // do something with both resources
      }
    }
  }
```

Infer has support for detecting these deadlocks too.

To suppress reports of deadlocks in a method `m()` use the
`@SuppressLint("DEADLOCK")` annotation, as follows:

```java
  import android.annotation.SuppressLint;

  @SuppressLint("DEADLOCK")
  public void m() {
  ...
  }
```

## DEAD_STORE

Reported as "Dead Store" by [liveness](/docs/checker-liveness).

This error is reported in C++. It fires when the value assigned to a variables
is never used (e.g., `int i = 1; i = 2; return i;`).

## DIRECT_ATOMIC_PROPERTY_ACCESS

Reported as "Direct Atomic Property Access" by [linters](/docs/checker-linters).

This check warns you when you are accessing an atomic property directly with an
ivar. This makes the atomic property not atomic anymore. So potentially you may
get a race condition.

To fix the problem you need to access properties with their getter or setter.

## DISCOURAGED_WEAK_PROPERTY_CUSTOM_SETTER

Reported as "Discouraged Weak Property Custom Setter" by [linters](/docs/checker-linters).

This check warns you when you have a custom setter for a weak property. When
compiled with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC, `-fobj-arc`) ARC may set the
property to `nil` without invoking the setter, for example:

```objectivec
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface Employee : NSObject {
  NSString* _name;
  __weak Employee* _manager;
}
-(id)initWithName:(NSString*)name;
@property(atomic, weak) Employee* manager;
-(void)report;
@end

@implementation Employee

-(id)initWithName:(NSString*)name {
  _name = name;
  return self;
}

-(NSString*)description {
  return _name;
}

-(void)report {
  NSLog(@"I work for %@", _manager);
}

-(Employee*)manager {
  return _manager;
}

// DON'T do this; ARC will not call this when setting _manager to nil.
-(void)setManager:(Employee*)newManager {
  NSLog(@"Meet the new boss...");
  _manager = newManager;
}

@end

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  Employee* bob = [[Employee alloc] initWithName:@"Bob"];
  Employee* sue = [[Employee alloc] initWithName:@"Sue"];
  bob.manager = sue;
  [bob report];
  sue = nil;
  [bob report];
  return 0;
}
```

This prints:

```
Meet the new boss...
I work for Sue
I work for (null)
```

Note that the custom setter was only invoked once.

## DIVIDE_BY_ZERO

Reported as "Divide By Zero" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).


## DOTNET_RESOURCE_LEAK

Reported as "Dotnet Resource Leak" by [dotnet-resource-leak](/docs/checker-dotnet-resource-leak).

Resource leak checker for .NET.
## EMPTY_VECTOR_ACCESS

Reported as "Empty Vector Access" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).

This error type is reported only in C++, in versions >= C++11.

The code is trying to access an element of a vector that Infer believes to be
empty. Such an access will cause undefined behavior at runtime.

```c++
#include <vector>
int foo(){
  const std::vector<int> vec;
  return vec[0]; // Empty vector access reported here
}
```

## ERADICATE_ANNOTATION_GRAPH

Reported as "Annotation Graph" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).


## ERADICATE_BAD_NESTED_CLASS_ANNOTATION

Reported as "@Nullsafe annotation is inconsistent with outer class" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).


## ERADICATE_CONDITION_REDUNDANT

Reported as "Condition Redundant" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).

This report is inactive by default. Condition (x != null) or (x == null) when x
cannot be null: the first condition is always true and the second is always
false

Example:

```java
class C {
  void m() {
    String s = new String("abc");
    if (s != null) {
      int n = s.length();
    }
  }
}
```

Action: Make sure that the annotations are correct, as the condition is
considered redundant based on the existing annotations. In particular, check the
annotation of any input parameters and fields of the current method, as well as
the annotations of any method called directly by the current method, if
relevant. If the annotations are correct, you can remove the redundant case.

## ERADICATE_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED

Reported as "Field Not Initialized" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).

The constructor does not initialize a field f which is not annotated with
@Nullable

Example:

```java
class C {
  String f;

  C () { // field f not initialized and not annotated @Nullable
  }
}
```

Action: The preferred action is to initialize the field with a value that is not
null. If, by design, null is a valid value for the field, then it should be
annotated with @Nullable.

## ERADICATE_FIELD_NOT_NULLABLE

Reported as "Field Not Nullable" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).

An assignment x.f = v where v could be null and field f is not annotated with
@Nullable.

Example:

```java
class C {
  String f;

  void foo(@Nullable String s) {
    f = s;
  }
}
```

Action: The preferred action is to ensure that a null value is never stored in
the field, by changing the code or changing annotations. If this cannot be done,
add a @Nullable annotation to the field. This annotation might trigger more
warnings in other code that uses the field, as that code must now deal with null
values.

## ERADICATE_FIELD_OVER_ANNOTATED

Reported as "Field Over Annotated" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).


## ERADICATE_INCONSISTENT_SUBCLASS_PARAMETER_ANNOTATION

Reported as "Inconsistent Subclass Parameter Annotation" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).

A parameter of the overridden method is missing a @Nullable annotation present in the superclass.

Action: choose a consistent annotation based on the desired invariant.

Example:

```java
class A {

  int len(@Nullable String s) {
    if (s != null) {
      return s.length();
    } else {
      return 0;
    }
  }
}

class B extends A {

  int len(String s) {  // @Nullable missing.
    return s.length();
  }
}
```

A consistent use of @Nullable on parameters across subtyping should prevent runtime issue like in:

```java
public class Main {

  String s;

  int foo() {
    A a = new B();
    return a.len(s);
  }
}
```


## ERADICATE_INCONSISTENT_SUBCLASS_RETURN_ANNOTATION

Reported as "Inconsistent Subclass Return Annotation" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).

The return type of the overridden method is annotated @Nullable, but the
corresponding method in the superclass is not.

Action: choose a consistent annotation based on the desired invariant.

Example:

```java
class A {
  String create() {
    return new String("abc");
  }
}

class B extends A {
  @Nullable String create() {  // Inconsistent @Nullable annotation.
      return null;
  }
}
```

A consistent use of `@Nullable` on the return type across subtyping should prevent
runtime issue like in:

```java
class Main {

  int foo(A a) {
     String s = a.create();
     return s.length();
  }

  void main(String[] args) {
     A a = new B();
     foo(a);
  }

}
```

## ERADICATE_META_CLASS_CAN_BE_NULLSAFE

Reported as "Class has 0 issues and can be marked @Nullsafe" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).


## ERADICATE_META_CLASS_IS_NULLSAFE

Reported as "Class is marked @Nullsafe and has 0 issues" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).


## ERADICATE_META_CLASS_NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT

Reported as "Class needs improvement to become @Nullsafe" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).

Reported when the class either:
- has at least one nullability issue, or
- has at least one (currently possibly hidden) issue preventing it from being marked `@Nullsafe`.

## ERADICATE_NULLABLE_DEREFERENCE

Reported as "Nullable Dereference" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).


## ERADICATE_PARAMETER_NOT_NULLABLE

Reported as "Parameter Not Nullable" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).

Method call x.m(..., v, ...) where v can be null and the corresponding parameter
in method m is not annotated with @Nullable

Example:

```java
class C {
  void m(C x) {
    String s = x.toString()
  }

  void test(@Nullable C x) {
    m(x);
  }
}
```

Action: The preferred action is to ensure that a null value is never passed to
the method, by changing the code or changing annotations. If this cannot be
done, add a @Nullable annotation to the relevant parameter in the method
declaration. This annotation might trigger more warnings in the implementation
of method m, as that code must now deal with null values.

## ERADICATE_REDUNDANT_NESTED_CLASS_ANNOTATION

Reported as "@Nullsafe annotation is redundant" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).


## ERADICATE_RETURN_NOT_NULLABLE

Reported as "Return Not Nullable" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).

Method m can return null, but the method's return type is not annotated with
@Nullable

Example:

```java
class C {
  String m() {
    return null;
  }
}
```

Action: The preferred action is to ensure that a null value is never returned by
the method, by changing the code or changing annotations. If this cannot be
done, add a @Nullable annotation to the the method declaration. This annotation
might trigger more warnings in the callers of method m, as the callers must now
deal with null values.

## ERADICATE_RETURN_OVER_ANNOTATED

Reported as "Return Over Annotated" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).

This report is inactive by default. Method m is annotated with @Nullable but the
method cannot return null

Example:

```java
class C {
  @Nullable String m() {
    String s = new String("abc");
    return s;
  }
}
```

Action: Make sure that the annotations are correct, as the return annotation is
considered redundant based on the existing annotations. In particular, check the
annotation of any input parameters and fields of the current method, as well as
the annotations of any method called directly by the current method, if
relevant. If the annotations are correct, you can remove the @Nullable
annotation.

## ERADICATE_UNCHECKED_USAGE_IN_NULLSAFE

Reported as "Nullsafe mode: unchecked usage of a value" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).


## ERADICATE_UNVETTED_THIRD_PARTY_IN_NULLSAFE

Reported as "Nullsafe mode: unchecked usage of unvetted third-party" by [eradicate](/docs/checker-eradicate).


## EXECUTION_TIME_COMPLEXITY_INCREASE

Reported as "Execution Time Complexity Increase" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

Infer reports this issue when the execution time complexity of a
program increases in degree: e.g. from constant to linear or from
logarithmic to quadratic. This issue type is only reported in
differential mode: i.e when we are comparing the analysis results of
two runs of infer on a file.



## EXECUTION_TIME_COMPLEXITY_INCREASE_UI_THREAD

Reported as "Execution Time Complexity Increase Ui Thread" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

Infer reports this issue when the execution time complexity of the procedure increases in degree **and** the procedure runs on the UI (main) thread.

Infer considers a method as running on the UI thread whenever:

- The method, one of its overrides, its class, or an ancestral class, is
  annotated with `@UiThread`.
- The method, or one of its overrides is annotated with `@OnEvent`, `@OnClick`,
  etc.
- The method or its callees call a `Litho.ThreadUtils` method such as
  `assertMainThread`.


## EXECUTION_TIME_UNREACHABLE_AT_EXIT

Reported as "Execution Time Unreachable At Exit" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

This issue type indicates that the program's execution doesn't reach
the exit node. Hence, we cannot compute a static bound for the
procedure.


Examples:
```java
void exit_unreachable() {
  exit(0); // modeled as unreachable
}


void infeasible_path_unreachable() {
    Preconditions.checkState(false); // like assert false, state pruned to bottom
}
```

## EXPENSIVE_AUTORELEASEPOOL_SIZE

Reported as "Expensive Autoreleasepool Size" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

\[EXPERIMENTAL\] This warning indicates that non-constant and non-top ObjC autoreleasepool's size in
the procedure.  By default, this issue type is disabled.

## EXPENSIVE_EXECUTION_TIME

Reported as "Expensive Execution Time" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

\[EXPERIMENTAL\] This warning indicates that non-constant and non-top execution time complexity of
the procedure.  By default, this issue type is disabled.

## EXPENSIVE_LOOP_INVARIANT_CALL

Reported as "Expensive Loop Invariant Call" by [loop-hoisting](/docs/checker-loop-hoisting).

We report this issue type when a function is [loop-invariant](/docs/all-issue-types#invariant_call) and also expensive (i.e. at least has linear complexity as determined by the [cost](/docs/checker-cost) analysis).

```java
int incr(int x) {
  return x + 1;
}

// incr will not be hoisted since it is cheap(constant time)
void foo_linear(int size) {
  int x = 10;
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    incr(x); // constant call, don't hoist
  }
}

// call to foo_linear will be hoisted since it is expensive(linear in size).
void symbolic_expensive_hoist(int size) {
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    foo_linear(size); // hoist
  }
}
```

## EXPOSED_INSECURE_INTENT_HANDLING

Reported as "Exposed Insecure Intent Handling" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Undocumented.
## GLOBAL_VARIABLE_INITIALIZED_WITH_FUNCTION_OR_METHOD_CALL

Reported as "Global Variable Initialized With Function Or Method Call" by [linters](/docs/checker-linters).

This checker warns you when the initialization of global variable contain a
method or function call. The warning wants to make you aware that some functions
are expensive. As the global variables are initialized before main() is called,
these initializations can slow down the start-up time of an app.

## GUARDEDBY_VIOLATION

Reported as "GuardedBy Violation" by [racerd](/docs/checker-racerd).

A field annotated with `@GuardedBy` is being accessed by a call-chain that starts at a non-private method without synchronization.

Example:

```java
class C {
  @GuardedBy("this")
  String f;

  void foo(String s) {
    f = s; // unprotected access here
  }
}
```

Action: Protect the offending access by acquiring the lock indicated by the `@GuardedBy(...)`.

## GUARDEDBY_VIOLATION_NULLSAFE

Reported as "GuardedBy Violation in `@Nullsafe` Class" by [racerd](/docs/checker-racerd).

A field annotated with `@GuardedBy` is being accessed by a call-chain that starts at a non-private method without synchronization.

Example:

```java
class C {
  @GuardedBy("this")
  String f;

  void foo(String s) {
    f = s; // unprotected access here
  }
}
```

Action: Protect the offending access by acquiring the lock indicated by the `@GuardedBy(...)`.

## IMPURE_FUNCTION

Reported as "Impure Function" by [impurity](/docs/checker-impurity).

This issue type indicates impure functions. For instance, below functions would be marked as impure:
```java
void makeAllZero_impure(ArrayList<Foo> list) {
  Iterator<Foo> listIterator = list.iterator();
  while (listIterator.hasNext()) {
    Foo foo = listIterator.next();
    foo.x = 0;
  }
}
```

## INEFFICIENT_KEYSET_ITERATOR

Reported as "Inefficient Keyset Iterator" by [inefficient-keyset-iterator](/docs/checker-inefficient-keyset-iterator).

This issue is raised when
- iterating over a HashMap with `ketSet()` iterator
- looking up the key each time

Instead, it is more efficient to iterate over the loop with `entrySet` which returns key-vaue pairs and gets rid of the hashMap lookup.
 For instance, we would raise an issue for the following program:

```java
void inefficient_loop_bad(HashMap<String, Integer> testMap) {
 for (String key : testMap.keySet()) {
   Integer value = testMap.get(key); // extra look-up cost
   foo(key, value);
 }
}
```

Instead, it is more efficient to have:
```java
void efficient_loop_ok(HashMap<String, Integer> testMap) {
  for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : testMap.entrySet()) {
    String key = entry.getKey();
    Integer value = entry.getValue();
    foo(key, value);
  }
}
```

## INFERBO_ALLOC_IS_BIG

Reported as "Inferbo Alloc Is Big" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

`malloc` is passed a large constant value.
## INFERBO_ALLOC_IS_NEGATIVE

Reported as "Inferbo Alloc Is Negative" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

`malloc` is called with a negative size.
## INFERBO_ALLOC_IS_ZERO

Reported as "Inferbo Alloc Is Zero" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

`malloc` is called with a zero size.
## INFERBO_ALLOC_MAY_BE_BIG

Reported as "Inferbo Alloc May Be Big" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

`malloc` *may* be called with a large value.
## INFERBO_ALLOC_MAY_BE_NEGATIVE

Reported as "Inferbo Alloc May Be Negative" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

`malloc` *may* be called with a negative value.
## INFINITE_AUTORELEASEPOOL_SIZE

Reported as "Infinite Autoreleasepool Size" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

\[EXPERIMENTAL\] This warning indicates that Infer was not able to determine a static upper bound on
the ObjC autoreleasepool's size in the procedure. By default, this issue type is disabled.

## INFINITE_EXECUTION_TIME

Reported as "Infinite Execution Time" by [cost](/docs/checker-cost).

This warning indicates that Infer was not able to determine a static
upper bound on the execution cost of the procedure. By default, this
issue type is disabled.


For instance, Inferbo's interval analysis is limited to affine
expressions. Hence, we can't statically estimate an upper bound on the
below example and obtain T(unknown) cost:
```java
// Expected: square root(x), got T
void square_root_FP(int x) {
 int i = 0;
 while (i * i < x) {
   i++;
 }
}
```

Consequently, we report an `INFINITE_EXECUTION_TIME`, corresponding to the biggest bound T.

## INSECURE_INTENT_HANDLING

Reported as "Insecure Intent Handling" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Undocumented.
## INTEGER_OVERFLOW_L1

Reported as "Integer Overflow L1" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

Integer overflows reports fall into several "buckets" corresponding to the expected precision of the
report. The higher the number, the more likely it is to be a false positive.

*   `L1`: The most faithful report, when it *must* be unsafe.  For example,
    `[2147483647,2147483647] + [1,1]` in 32-bit signed integer type.

*   `L2`: Less faithful report than `L1`, when it *may* be unsafe.  For example,
    `[2147483647,2147483647] + [0,1]` in 32-bit signed integer type.  Note that the integer of RHS
    can be 0, which is safe.

*   `L5`: The reports that are not included in the above cases.

*   `U5`: A binary integer operation is unsafe by unknown values, which are usually from unknown
    function calls.

See [INTEGER_OVERFLOW_L1](#integer_overflow_l1)
## INTERFACE_NOT_THREAD_SAFE

Reported as "Interface Not Thread Safe" by [racerd](/docs/checker-racerd).

This error indicates that you have invoked an interface method not annotated
with `@ThreadSafe` from a thread-safe context (e.g., code that uses locks or is
marked `@ThreadSafe`). The fix is to add the `@ThreadSafe` annotation to the
interface or to the interface method. For background on why these annotations
are needed, see the detailed explanation
[here](/docs/checker-racerd#interface-not-thread-safe).

## INVARIANT_CALL

Reported as "Invariant Call" by [loop-hoisting](/docs/checker-loop-hoisting).

We report this issue type when a function call is loop-invariant and hoistable, i.e.
- the function has no side side effects (pure)
- has invariant arguments and result (i.e. have the same value in all loop iterations)
- it is guaranteed to execute, i.e. it dominates all loop sources

```java
int foo(int x, int y) {
 return x + y;
}


void invariant_hoist(int size) {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 5;
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      foo(x, y); // hoistable
    }
  }
```

## IPC_ON_UI_THREAD

Reported as "Ipc On Ui Thread" by [starvation](/docs/checker-starvation).

A blocking `Binder` IPC call occurs on the UI thread.
## IVAR_NOT_NULL_CHECKED

Reported as "Ivar Not Null Checked" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).

This error type is only reported in Objective-C. This is similar to Null
dereference, but Infer hasn't found a whole trace where the error can happen,
but only found that a null dereference can happen if an instance variable of a
parameter is `nil`. For example:

```objectivec
  -(int) foo {
      B b* = [self->_a foo]; // sending a message with receiver nil returns nil
      return b->x; // dereferencing b, potential NPE if you pass nil as the argument a.
  }
```

Possible solutions are adding a check for `nil`, or making sure that the method
is not called with `nil`.

## JAVASCRIPT_INJECTION

Untrusted data flows into JavaScript.
## LAB_RESOURCE_LEAK

Reported as "Lab Resource Leak" by [resource-leak-lab](/docs/checker-resource-leak-lab).

Toy issue.
## LOCKLESS_VIOLATION

Reported as "Lockless Violation" by [starvation](/docs/checker-starvation).

A method implements an interface signature annotated with `@Lockless` but which transitively acquires a lock.

Example:

```java
Interface I {
    @Lockless
    public void no_lock();
}

class C implements I {
  private synchronized do_lock() {}

  public void no_lock() { // this method should not acquire any locks
    do_lock();
  }
}
```

## LOCK_CONSISTENCY_VIOLATION

Reported as "Lock Consistency Violation" by [racerd](/docs/checker-racerd).

This is an error reported on C++ and Objective C classes whenever:

- Some class method directly uses locking primitives (not transitively).
- It has a public method which writes to some member `x` while holding a lock.
- It has a public method which reads `x` without holding a lock.

The above may happen through a chain of calls. Above, `x` may also be a
container (an array, a vector, etc).

### Fixing Lock Consistency Violation reports

- Avoid the offending access (most often the read). Of course, this may not be
  possible.
- Use synchronization to protect the read, by using the same lock protecting the
  corresponding write.
- Make the method doing the read access private. This should silence the
  warning, since Infer looks for a pair of non-private methods. Objective-C:
  Infer considers a method as private if it's not exported in the header-file
  interface.

## LOGGING_PRIVATE_DATA

Reported as "Logging Private Data" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Undocumented.
## MEMORY_LEAK

Reported as "Memory Leak" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

### Memory leak in C

This error type is only reported in C and Objective-C code. In Java we do not
report memory leaks because it is a garbage collected language.

In C, Infer reports memory leaks when objects are created with `malloc` and not
freed. For example:

```c
-(void) memory_leak_bug {
    struct Person *p = malloc(sizeof(struct Person));
}
```

### Memory leak in Objective-C

Additionally, in Objective-C, Infer reports memory leaks that happen when
objects from Core Foundation or Core Graphics don't get released.

```objectivec
-(void) memory_leak_bug_cf {
    CGPathRef shadowPath = CGPathCreateWithRect(self.inputView.bounds, NULL); //object created and not released.
}
```

## MISSING_REQUIRED_PROP

Reported as "Missing Required Prop" by [litho-required-props](/docs/checker-litho-required-props).

As explained by the analysis.
## MIXED_SELF_WEAKSELF

Reported as "Mixed Self WeakSelf" by [self-in-block](/docs/checker-self-in-block).

This happens when an Objective-C block captures both `self` and `weakSelf`, a
weak pointer to `self`. Possibly the developer meant to capture only `weakSelf`
to avoid a retain cycle, but made a typo and used `self` as well in the block,
instead of `strongSelf`. In this case, this could cause a retain cycle.

## MODIFIES_IMMUTABLE

Reported as "Modifies Immutable" by [impurity](/docs/checker-impurity).

This issue type indicates modifications to fields marked as @Immutable. For instance, below function `mutateArray` would be marked as modifying immutable field `testArray`:
```java
  @Immutable int[] testArray = new int[]{0, 1, 2, 4};
  
  int[] getTestArray() {
    return testArray;
  }                
          
  void mutateArray() {
    int[] array = getTestArray();
    array[2] = 7;
  }
```

## MULTIPLE_WEAKSELF

Reported as "Multiple WeakSelf Use" by [self-in-block](/docs/checker-self-in-block).

An Objective-C block uses `weakSelf` more than once. This could lead to
unexpected behaviour. Even if `weakSelf` is not nil in the first use, it could
be nil in the following uses since the object that `weakSelf` points to could be
freed anytime. One should assign it to a strong pointer first, and then use it
in the block.

## NIL_MESSAGING_TO_NON_POD

Reported as "Nil Messaging To Non Pod" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

See [NULLPTR_DEREFERENCE](#nullptr_dereference).
## NULLPTR_DEREFERENCE

Reported as "Nullptr Dereference" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

Infer reports null dereference bugs in Java, C, C++, and Objective-C
when it is possible that the null pointer is dereferenced, leading to
a crash.

### Null dereference in Java

Many of Infer's reports of potential Null Pointer Exceptions (NPE) come from code of the form

```java
  p = foo(); // foo() might return null
  stuff();
  p.goo();   // dereferencing p, potential NPE
```

If you see code of this form, then you have several options.

**If you are unsure whether or not `foo()` will return null**, you should
ideally either

1. Change the code to ensure that `foo()` can not return null, or

2. Add a check that `p` is not `null` before dereferencing `p`.

Sometimes, in case (2) it is not obvious what you should do when `p`
is `null`. One possibility is to throw an exception, failing early but
explicitly. This can be done using `checkNotNull` as in the following
code:

```java
// code idiom for failing early
import static com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkNotNull;

  //... intervening code

  p = checkNotNull(foo()); // foo() might return null
  stuff();
  p.goo(); // p cannot be null here
```

The call `checkNotNull(foo())` will never return `null`: if `foo()`
returns `null` then it fails early by throwing a Null Pointer
Exception.

Facebook NOTE: **If you are absolutely sure that foo() will not be
null**, then if you land your diff this case will no longer be
reported after your diff makes it to master.

### Null dereference in C

Here is an example of an inter-procedural null dereference bug in C:

```c
struct Person {
  int age;
  int height;
  int weight;
};
int get_age(struct Person *who) {
  return who->age;
}
int null_pointer_interproc() {
  struct Person *joe = 0;
  return get_age(joe);
}
```

### Null dereference in Objective-C

In Objective-C, null dereferences are less common than in Java, but they still
happen and their cause can be hidden. In general, passing a message to nil does
not cause a crash and returns `nil`, but dereferencing a pointer directly does
cause a crash as well as calling a `nil` block.C

```objectivec
-(void) foo:(void (^)())callback {
    callback();
}

-(void) bar {
    [self foo:nil]; //crash
}
```

Moreover, there are functions from the libraries that do not allow `nil` to be
passed as argument. Here are some examples:

```objectivec
-(void) foo {
    NSString *str = nil;
    NSArray *animals = @[@"horse", str, @"dolphin"]; //crash
}

-(void) bar {
  CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB(); //can return NULL
  ...
  CFRelease(colorSpace); //crashes if called with NULL
}
```

## NULL_DEREFERENCE

Reported as "Null Dereference" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).

See [NULLPTR_DEREFERENCE](#nullptr_dereference).
## OPTIONAL_EMPTY_ACCESS

Reported as "Optional Empty Access" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

Optional Empty Access warnings are reported when we try to retrieve the value of a [`folly::Optional`](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/Optional.h) when it is empty (i.e. `folly::none`).

In the following example we get a warning as `int_opt` might be `folly::none` and its value is being accessed:

```cpp
bool somef(int v);

folly::Optional<int> mightReturnNone(int v) {
   if (somef(v)) {
      return folly::Optional(v);
   }

   return folly::none;
}

int value_no_check() {
  folly::Optional<int> int_opt = mightReturnNone (4);
  return int_opt.value(); // Optional Empty Access warning
}
```

We do not get the warning anymore if we add a check whether `int_opt` is not empty:

```cpp
int value_check() {
  folly::Optional<int> int_opt = mightReturnNone (4);
  if (int_opt.has_value()) {
     return int_opt.value(); // OK
  }
  return -1;
}
```

In some cases we know that we have a non-empty value and there is no need to have a check. Consider the following example where Infer does not warn:

```cpp
bool somef(int v) {return v > 3;};

folly::Optional<int> mightReturnNone(int v) {
   if (somef(v)) {
      return folly::Optional(v);
   }

   return folly::none;
}

int value_no_check() {
  folly::Optional<int> int_opt = mightReturnNone (4); // cannot be folly::none
  return int_opt.value(); // OK
}
```

## PARAMETER_NOT_NULL_CHECKED

Reported as "Parameter Not Null Checked" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).

This error type is reported only in Objective-C. It is similar to Null
dereference, but Infer hasn't found a whole trace where the error can happen,
but only found that a null dereference can happen if you call a method with nil
as an argument. Therefore it is only a warning. For example:

```objectivec
  -(int) foo:(A* a) {
      B b* = [a foo]; // sending a message with receiver nil returns nil
      return b->x; // dereferencing b, potential NPE if you pass nil as the argument a.
  }
```

or when the parameter is a block:

```objectivec
   -(void) foo:(void (^)(BOOL))block {
      block(YES); // calling a nil block will cause a crash.
   }
```

Possible solutions are adding a check for `nil`, or making sure that the method
is not called with `nil`. When an argument will never be `nil`, you can add the
annotation `nonnull` to the argument's type, to tell Infer (and the type
system), that the argument won't be `nil`. This will silence the warning.

## POINTER_TO_CONST_OBJC_CLASS

Reported as "Pointer To Const Objc Class" by [linters](/docs/checker-linters).

In Objective-C, `const Class *` represents a mutable pointer pointing to an
Objective-C class where the ivars cannot be changed. More useful is
`Class *const` instead, meaning the destination of the pointer cannot be
changed.

## PREMATURE_NIL_TERMINATION_ARGUMENT

Reported as "Premature Nil Termination Argument" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).

This error type is reported in C and Objective-C. In many variadic methods,
`nil` is used to signify the end of the list of input objects. This is similar
to nil-termination of C strings. If one of the arguments that is not the last
argument to the method is `nil` as well, Infer reports an error because that may
lead to unexpected behavior.

An example of such variadic methods is
[arrayWithObjects](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/NSArray/arrayWithObjects)

```objectivec
  NSArray *foo = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"aaa", str, @"bbb", nil];
```

In this example, if `str` is `nil` then an array `@[@"aaa"]` of size 1 will be
created, and not an array `@[@"aaa", str, @"bbb"]` of size 3 as expected.

## PULSE_UNINITIALIZED_VALUE

Reported as "Uninitialized Value" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

See [UNINITIALIZED_VALUE](#uninitialized_value). Re-implemented using Pulse.
## PURE_FUNCTION

Reported as "Pure Function" by [purity](/docs/checker-purity).

This issue type indicates pure functions. For instance, below functions would be marked as pure:

```java
int local_write_pure(int x, int y) {
  int k = x + y;
  k++;
  return k;
}

// no change to outside state, the local allocation is ok.
int local_alloc_pure(ArrayList<Integer> list) {
  ArrayList<Integer> list_new = new ArrayList<Integer>();
  for (Integer el : list) {
    list_new.add(el);
  }
  return list_new.size();
}
```

However, the following ones would not be pure:

```java
void swap_impure(int[] array, int i, int j) {
  int tmp = array[i];
  array[i] = array[j]; // modifying the input array
  array[j] = tmp;
}

int a = 0;
void set_impure(int x, int y) {
  a = x + y; //modifying a global variable
}
```

## QUANDARY_TAINT_ERROR

Reported as "Taint Error" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Generic taint error when nothing else fits.
## RESOURCE_LEAK

Reported as "Resource Leak" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).

Infer reports resource leaks in C, Objective-C and Java. In general, resources
are entities such as files, sockets, connections, etc, that need to be closed
after being used.

### Resource leak in C

This is an example of a resource leak in C code:

```c
-(void) resource_leak_bug {
    FILE *fp;
    fp=fopen("c:\\test.txt", "r"); // file opened and not closed.
}
```

### Resource leak in Java

For the remaining of this section, we will consider examples of resource leaks
in Java code.

TIP: A common source of bugs is <b>exceptions skipping past close()
statements</b>. That is the first thing to look for if INFER reports a potential
resource leak.

### Basics and Standard Idiom

Some objects in Java, the <i>resources</i>, are supposed to be closed when you
stop using them, and failure to close is a <i>resource leak</i>. Resources
include input streams, output streams, readers, writers, sockets, http
connections, cursors, and json parsers.

The standard idiom is

```java
  // Standard idiom
  Allocate resource
  try {
    do some stuff
  } finally {
    close resource
  }
```

or more for example,

```java
  //  Standard Idiom
  public static void foo () throws IOException{
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("whatever.txt"));
    try {
      fos.write(7);
    } finally {
      fos.close();
    }
  }
```

and you should use the standard idiom for the most part, when you don't want to
return the resource to the surrounding context.

Sometimes people just leave out close(), and that is a bug, but more typically
exceptional paths are the root of the problem, as in

```java
  // leak because of exception
  public static void foo () throws IOException {
    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("whatever.txt"));
    fos.write(7);   //DOH! What if exception?
    fos.close();
  }
```

where an exception in fos.write will cause execution to skip past the close()
statement.

#### Multiple Resources Bugs

We can deal with multiple resources correctly and simply just by nesting the
standard idiom.

```java
  // Two Resources nested
  public static void foo() throws IOException {
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(new File("whatever.txt"));
    try {
      FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("everwhat.txt"));
      try {
        fos.write(fis.read());
      } finally {
        fos.close();
      }
    } finally {
      fis.close();
    }
  }
```

Bugs often occur when using multiple resources in other ways because of
exceptions in close() methods. For example,

```java
  // Classic Two Resources Bug
  public static void foo() throws IOException {
    FileInputStream fis = null;
    FileOutputStream fos = null;
    try {
      fis = new FileInputStream(new File("whatever.txt"));
      fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("everwhat.txt"));
      fos.write(fis.read());
    } finally {
      if (fis!=null)  fis.close();
      if (fos!=null) fos.close();
    }
  }
```

Here, if there is an exception in the call to fis.close() execution will skip
past fos.close(); a leak.

Another way, besides the standard idiom, to deal with this problem is to swallow
exceptions.

```java
  // Two Resources Fix 1
  public static void foo() throws IOException {
    FileInputStream fis = null;
    FileOutputStream fos = null;
    try {
      fis = new FileInputStream(new File("whatever.txt"));
      fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("everwhat.txt"));
      fos.write(fis.read());
    } finally {
      try {
        if (fis!=null) fis.close();
      } catch (Exception e) {};  // Exception swallowing
      if (fos!=null) fos.close();
    }
  }
```

You can also swallow the exception on the output stream. Some people prefer not
to swallow output stream exceptions, and also flush before closing.
http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1118

Notice that the nested standard idiom does not need the checks for null, which
are in there in this case to protect against the case when one of the
allocations throws an exception, in which case one would get a
NullPointerException.

### Nested_Allocations

When a resource allocation is included as an argument to a constructor, if the
constructor fails it can leave an an unreachable resource that no one can close.

For example gzipOutputStream = new GZIPOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(out));
is bad in case the outer constructor, GZIPOutputStream, throws an exception. In
that case, no one will have a hold of the FileOutputStream and so no one will be
able to close it.

In such a case you need to move the allocation the FileOutputStream out of the
nested position and name it, so you are able to close if anything goes wrong
during execution of the GZIPOutputStream constructor.

Here are resources that can throw exceptions i their constructor(s).

- ObjectInputStream , ObjectOutputStream, PipedInputStream, PipedOutputStream,
  PipedReader, PipedWriter, JarInputStream, JarOutputStream, GZIPInputStream,
  GZIPOutputStream , ZipFile all throw IOException
- PrintStream throws UnsupportedEncodingException

The constructors for FileInputStream, FileOutputStream and RandomAccessFile
throw FileNotFoundException, but these cases are not problematic in the sense
that their arguments are not resources and so they do not cause the nested
resource leak.

### Allocation of JSonParser and Cursor resources

Some resources are created inside libraries instead of by "new".

Cursor is an interface, the actual resources are something like SQLiteCursor.
So, every time you call a function that returns a Cursor object, there is an
allocation.

For instance, in the functions from SQLiteDatabase query(…) and rawQuery(…)
allocate a cursor resource. For SQLiteQueryBuilder, ContentProviderClient,
ContentResolver. MediaStore and DownloadManager it is only query(…) Cursor
objects cursor created by these functions need to be closed (i.e.,
cursor.close()).

Similarly, JsonParser is an abstract class, and create a resource in functions
from the class JsonFactory createParser(byte[] data) createParser(byte[] data,
int offset, int len) createParser(String content) createParser(URL url)
createParser(File f) JsonParser objects js created by these functions need to be
closed (jp.close()). On the other hand . JasonParsers gotten from
createParser(InputStream in) and createParser(Reader r) give you JsonParsers
that don’t need to be closed. This is because they receive the resource from
somewhere that will maintain the responsibility to close it.

### Escaping resources and exceptions

Sometimes you want to return a resource to the outside, in which case you should
not close it, but you still need to be careful of exceptions in case control
skips past the return leaving no one to close. Here is a simple example of a
positive use of escaping resources.

```java
  // An escaping resource, shouldn't close
  public BugReportAttachment createAttachment(File reportDirectory, String fileName)
      throws FileNotFoundException {
    File file = new File(reportDirectory, fileName);
    OutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(file);
    return new BugReportAttachment(Uri.fromFile(file), stream);
  }
```

In this case it is intended that an object that wraps `stream` is passed to the
caller of `createAttachment`. You should certainly not close stream here,
because it is being passed to the outside.

But for escaping resources like this you still need to be careful of exceptions.
For example, in

```java
  // An escaping resource, and a leak
  public BugReportAttachment createAttachment(File reportDirectory, String fileName)
      throws FileNotFoundException {
    File file = new File(reportDirectory, fileName);
    OutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(file);
    stream.write(7);
    return new BugReportAttachment(Uri.fromFile(file), stream);
  }
```

if stream.write(7) throws an exception, then no one will have a hold of stream,
and no one will be able to close it; a leak.

### Java 7's try-with-resources

**(For use with Java 7 only)**

Clearly, accounting for the ramifications of all the exceptional cases is
complicated, and there is a better way in Java 7.

```java
  // Two Resources Fix 2; via try-with-resources
  public static void foo() throws IOException {
    try (
      FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(new File("whatever.txt"));
      FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("everwhat.txt"))
    ) {
      fos.write(fis.read());
    }
  }
```

All the complicated exceptional cases above are (apparently) covered by this
construct, and the result is much simpler.

So, if you are trying to fix a potential leak in code with multiples resources
you can go ahead and try to understand whether the potential leak is real. Or,
if the code is complex and it is hard to figure out, it would be perfectly
legitimate to simply convert the code over to try-with-resources if you have
access to Java 7, so as to save yourself some brain-cycles. You will also end up
with cleaner code.

If try-with-resources is so great you should <i>always</i> use it. But you
shouldn't… Try-with-resources gives resources static scoping, and works via a
stack discipline. Sometimes, you want a resource to persist beyond scope, as in
the escaping example above. In an escaping example maybe you could refactor lots
of code so that try-with-resources applies, and maybe you cannot in a sensible
way. This just illustrates that, though you might hear people say that
try-with-resources "solves" the resource problem, it does not. It is very
useful, but you cannot use it blindly when you see a resource-allocation site.

## RETAIN_CYCLE

Reported as "Retain Cycle" by [biabduction](/docs/checker-biabduction).

A retain cycle is a situation when object A retains object B, and object B
retains object A at the same time. Here is an example:

```objectivec
@class Child;
@interface Parent : NSObject {
    Child *child; // Instance variables are implicitly __strong
}
@end
@interface Child : NSObject {
    Parent *parent;
}
@end
```

You can fix a retain cycle in ARC by using \_\_weak variables or weak properties
for your "back links", i.e. links to direct or indirect parents in an object
hierarchy:

```objectivec
@class Child;
@interface Parent : NSObject {
    Child *child;
}
@end
@interface Child : NSObject {
    __weak Parent *parent;
}
@end
```

## SHELL_INJECTION

Reported as "Shell Injection" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Environment variable or file data flowing to shell.
## SHELL_INJECTION_RISK

Reported as "Shell Injection Risk" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Code injection if the caller of the endpoint doesn't sanitize on its end.
## SQL_INJECTION

Reported as "Sql Injection" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Untrusted and unescaped data flows to SQL.
## SQL_INJECTION_RISK

Reported as "Sql Injection Risk" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Untrusted and unescaped data flows to SQL.
## STACK_VARIABLE_ADDRESS_ESCAPE

Reported as "Stack Variable Address Escape" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

Reported when an address pointing into the stack of the current
function will escape to its calling context. Such addresses will
become invalid by the time the function actually returns so are
potentially dangerous.

For example, directly returning a pointer to a local variable:

```C
int* foo() {
   int x = 42;
   return &x; // <-- warn here that "&x" will escape
}
```

## STARVATION

Reported as "UI Thread Starvation" by [starvation](/docs/checker-starvation).

This error is reported in Java, and specifically on Android. These reports are
triggered when a method that runs on the UI thread may block, thus potentially
leading to an Application Not Responding error.

Infer considers a method as running on the UI thread whenever:

- The method, one of its overrides, its class, or an ancestral class, is
  annotated with `@UiThread`.
- The method, or one of its overrides is annotated with `@OnEvent`, `@OnClick`,
  etc.
- The method or its callees call a `Litho.ThreadUtils` method such as
  `assertMainThread`.

The issue is reported when a method deemed to run on the UI thread

- Makes a method call which may block.
- Takes a lock, and another thread takes the same lock, and before releasing it,
  makes a call that may block.

Calls that may block are considered:

- Certain I/O calls.
- Two way `Binder.transact` calls.
- Certain OS calls.
- `Future` or `AsyncTask` calls to `get` without timeouts, or with too large
  timeouts.

To suppress starvation reports in a method `m()` use the
`@SuppressLint("STARVATION")` annotation, as follows:

```java
  import android.annotation.SuppressLint;

  @SuppressLint("STARVATION")
  public void m() {
  ...
  }
```

To signal to Infer that a method does not perform any blocking calls, despite
appearences, you can use the `@NonBlocking` annotation:

```java
  import com.facebook.infer.annotation.NonBlocking;

  @NonBlocking
  public void m() {
  ...
  }
```

This instructs Infer to filter out any potentially blocking calls in `m()`
(also, transitively), and thus any other method can expect no starvation reports
due to a call to `m()`. You will need to set up your class path appropriately to
include the JAR files in `infer/annotations` for this annotation to work.

## STATIC_INITIALIZATION_ORDER_FIASCO

Reported as "Static Initialization Order Fiasco" by [siof](/docs/checker-siof).

This error is reported in C++. It fires when the initialization of a static
variable `A`, accesses a static variable `B` from another translation unit
(usually another `.cpp` file). There are no guarantees whether `B` has been
already initialized or not at that point.

For more technical definition and techniques to avoid/remediate, see the
[FAQ](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/ctors#static-init-order).

## STRICT_MODE_VIOLATION

Reported as "Strict Mode Violation" by [starvation](/docs/checker-starvation).

Android has a feature called
[strict mode](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/StrictMode),
which if enabled, will flag the occasions where the main thread makes a call
that results in disk I/O, waiting on a network socket, etc. The analysis
catching starvation errors and deadlocks (the `--starvation` analysis) has the
ability to statically detect such violations.

To suppress this warning, it's enough to annotate the offending method with
`@SuppressLint("STRICT_MODE_VIOLATION")`.

## STRONG_DELEGATE_WARNING

Reported as "Strong Delegate Warning" by [linters](/docs/checker-linters).

This check warns you when you have a property called delegate or variations
thereof which is declared strong. The idea is that delegates should generally be
weak, otherwise this may cause retain cycles.

## STRONG_SELF_NOT_CHECKED

Reported as "StrongSelf Not Checked" by [self-in-block](/docs/checker-self-in-block).

When a block captures `weakSelf` in the following pattern:

```
__weak __typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
  int (^my_block)() = ^() {
    __strong __typeof(weakSelf) strongSelf = weakSelf;
    int y = strongSelf->x;
```

the variable `strongSelf` should be checked for `null` before being used,
otherwise this could cause a crash because the weak pointer `weakSelf` could be
`null`.

## THREAD_SAFETY_VIOLATION

Reported as "Thread Safety Violation" by [racerd](/docs/checker-racerd).

This warning indicates a potential data race in Java. The analyser is called
RacerD and this section gives brief but a mostly complete description of its
features. See the [RacerD page](/docs/checker-racerd) for more in-depth information and
examples.

### Thread-safety: What is a data race

Here a data race is a pair of accesses to the same member field such that:

- at least one is a write, and,
- at least one occurs without any lock synchronization, and,
- the two accesses occur on threads (if known) which can run in parallel.

### Thread-safety: Potential fixes

- Synchronizing the accesses (using the `synchronized` keyword, thread-exclusion
  such as atomic objects, `volatile` etc).
- Making an offending method private -- this will exclude it from being checked
  at the top level, though it will be checked if called by a public method which
  may itself, e.g., hold a lock when calling it.
- Putting the two accesses on the same thread, e.g., by using `@MainThread` or
  `@ThreadConfined`.

### Thread-safety: Conditions checked before reporting

The class and method are not marked `@ThreadSafe(enableChecks = false)`, and,

- The method is declared `synchronized`, or employs (non-transitively) locking,
  or,
- The class is not marked `@NotThreadSafe`, and,
  - The class/method is marked `@ThreadSafe,` or one of the configured synonyms
    in `.inferconfig`, or,
  - A parent class, or an override method are marked with the above annotations.

NB currently RacerD **does not take into account `@GuardedBy`**.

### Thread-safety: Thread annotations recognized by RacerD

These class and method annotations imply the method is on the main thread:
`@MainThread`, `@UiThread`

These method annotations imply the method is on the main thread: `@OnBind`,
`@OnEvent`, `@OnMount`, `@OnUnbind`, `@OnUnmount`

Both classes of annotations work through the inheritance tree (i.e. if a parent
class or method is marked with one of these annotations, so is the child class /
method override).

In addition to these, RacerD recognizes many lifecycle methods as necessarily
running on the main thread, eg `Fragment.onCreate` etc.

Finally, the thread status of being on the main thread propagates backwards
through the call graph (ie if `foo` calls `bar` and `bar` is marked `@UiThtread`
then `foo` is automatically considered on the main thread too). Calling
`assertMainThread`, `assertOnUiThread`, `checkOnMainThread` has the same effect.

NB RacerD currently **does not recognize `@WorkerThread`, `@BinderThread` or
`@AnyThread`**.

### Thread-safety: Other annotations and what they do

These annotations can be found at `com.facebook.infer.annotation.*`.

- `@Functional` This is a method annotation indicating the method always returns
  the same value. When a method `foo` is annotated `@Functional`, RacerD will
  ignore any writes of the return value of `foo`. For example, in
  `this.x = foo()`, the write to `this.x` is ignored. The reasoning is that if
  the method returns the same value whenever it's called, any data race on
  `this.x` is benign, if that is the only write.

- `@ThreadConfined` This is a class/method/field annotation which takes a single
  parameter which can be `UI`, `ANY` or a user chosen string. It indicates to
  RacerD a thread identifier for the class/method/field. Thus,
  `@ThreadConfined(UI)` is equivalent to `@UiThread`, and `@ThreadConfined(ANY)`
  is equivalent to not having the annotation at all, for classes and methods.
  When this annotation is applied to a field it instructs Infer to assume
  (without checking) that all accesses to that field are made on the same thread
  (and can, therefore, not race by definition). The intention is that RacerD
  uses that to detect exclusion between accesses occurring on the same thread.
  However, only the UI thread is supported at this time, and any user provided
  value is considered equal to `UI`.

- `@VisibleForTesting` A method annotation making Infer consider the method as
  effectively `private`. This means it will not be checked for races against
  other non-private methods of the class, but only if called by one.

- `@ReturnsOwnership` A method annotation indicating that the method returns a
  freshly owned object. Accesses to the returned value will not be considered
  for data races, as the object is in-effect unique and not accessible yet from
  other threads. The main utility of this annotation is in interfaces, where
  Infer cannot look up the implementation and decide for itself.

## THREAD_SAFETY_VIOLATION_NULLSAFE

Reported as "Thread Safety Violation in `@Nullsafe` Class" by [racerd](/docs/checker-racerd).

A [Thread Safety Violation](#thread_safety_violation) in a `@Nullsafe` class.
## TOPL_ERROR

Reported as "Topl Error" by [topl](/docs/checker-topl).

A violation of a Topl property (user-specified).
## UNINITIALIZED_VALUE

Reported as "Uninitialized Value" by [uninit](/docs/checker-uninit).

A value is read before it has been initialized. For example, in C:

```C
struct coordinates {
  int x;
  int y;
};

void foo() {
  struct coordinates c;
  c.x = 42;
  c.y++; // uninitialized value c.y!

  int z;
  if (z == 0) { // uninitialized value z!
    // something
  }
}
```

## UNREACHABLE_CODE

Reported as "Unreachable Code" by [bufferoverrun](/docs/checker-bufferoverrun).

A program point is unreachable.
## UNTRUSTED_BUFFER_ACCESS

Reported as "Untrusted Buffer Access" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Untrusted data of any kind flowing to buffer.
## UNTRUSTED_DESERIALIZATION

Reported as "Untrusted Deserialization" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

User-controlled deserialization.
## UNTRUSTED_DESERIALIZATION_RISK

Reported as "Untrusted Deserialization Risk" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

## UNTRUSTED_HEAP_ALLOCATION

Reported as "Untrusted Heap Allocation" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Untrusted data of any kind flowing to heap allocation. this can cause crashes or DOS.
## UNTRUSTED_INTENT_CREATION

Reported as "Untrusted Intent Creation" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Creating an Intent from user-controlled data.
## UNTRUSTED_URL_RISK

Reported as "Untrusted Url Risk" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Untrusted flag, environment variable, or file data flowing to URL.
## UNTRUSTED_VARIABLE_LENGTH_ARRAY

Reported as "Untrusted Variable Length Array" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Untrusted data of any kind flowing to stack buffer allocation. Trying to allocate a stack buffer that's too large will cause a stack overflow.
## USER_CONTROLLED_SQL_RISK

Reported as "User Controlled Sql Risk" by [quandary](/docs/checker-quandary).

Untrusted data flows to SQL (no injection risk).
## USE_AFTER_DELETE

Reported as "Use After Delete" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

An address that was invalidated by a call to `delete` in C++ is dereferenced.

## USE_AFTER_FREE

Reported as "Use After Free" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

An address that was invalidated by a call to `free` in C is dereferenced.

## USE_AFTER_LIFETIME

Reported as "Use After Lifetime" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

The lifetime of an object has ended but that object is being
accessed. For example, the address of a variable holding a C++ object
is accessed after the variable has gone out of scope:

```C++
void foo() {
     X* p;
     { // new scope
       X x = X();
       p = &x;
     } // x has gone out of scope
     p->method(); // ERROR: you should not access *p after x has gone out of scope
}
```

## VECTOR_INVALIDATION

Reported as "Vector Invalidation" by [pulse](/docs/checker-pulse).

An address pointing into a C++ `std::vector` might have become
invalid. This can happen when an address is taken into a vector, then
the vector is mutated in a way that might invalidate the address, for
example by adding elements to the vector, which might trigger a
re-allocation of the entire vector contents (thereby invalidating the
pointers into the previous location of the contents).

For example:

```C++
void deref_vector_element_after_push_back_bad(std::vector<int>& vec) {
  int* elt = &vec[1];
  vec.push_back(42); // if the array backing the vector was full already, this
                     // will re-allocate it and copy the previous contents
                     // into the new array, then delete the previous array
  std::cout << *y << "\n"; // bad: elt might be invalid
}
```

## WEAK_SELF_IN_NO_ESCAPE_BLOCK

Reported as "Weak Self In No Escape Block" by [self-in-block](/docs/checker-self-in-block).

In many methods that take a block as an argument, the block position is
annotated with NS_NOESCAPE to mark that the block passed to this method won't be
leaving the current scope. In those cases, there is no need to use `weakSelf` to
avoid the block to capture `self`. This issue type flags this case.
