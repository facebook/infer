Detection of object cast from immutable types to mutable types. For instance, it will detect casts from `ImmutableList` to `List`, `ImmutableMap` to `Map`, and `ImmutableSet` to `Set`.

**\*\*\*DEPRECATED\*\*\*** Unmaintained due to poor actionability of the reports.

Activate with `--immutable-cast`.

Supported languages:
- C/C++/ObjC: No
- C#/.Net: Yes

Casts flagged by this checker are unsafe because calling mutation operations on the cast objects will fail at runtime.
