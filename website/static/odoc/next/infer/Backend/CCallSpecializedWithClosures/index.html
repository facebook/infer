One complication is with the captured variables in the closure: we add them to the formals of the cloned method and pass them through to the concrete closures. We do this transformation in two steps:</p><p>1. Go through all the callers of methods with closures as parameters, and create the clone methods. In this preanalysis we only create the attributes for the new method, not the code. We also update the call instructions in the callers to represent a call to the cloned method with updated arguments: we don't need to pass closure's arguments anymore, we instead pass the captured variables as new arguments.</p><p>2. (In ClosureSubstSpecializedMethod.ml) We add the corresponding code to the newly created clones: this means swapping the call to the closure variable with a call to the corresponding closure. Moreover, we add some of the new formals (that correspond to the captured variables) to the arguments of the call.</p></header><div class="odoc-content"><div class="odoc-spec"><div class="spec value anchored" id="val-process"><a href="#val-process" class="anchor"></a><code><span><span class="keyword">val</span> process : <span><a href="../../IR/Procdesc/index.html#type-t">IR.Procdesc.t</a> <span class="arrow">&#45;&gt;</span></span> unit</span></code></div></div></div></body></html>
