##What is Infer?

Infer is a static analyzer, designed to find bugs in Java and C projects and Objective-C.

##Using Infer

Start with our <a href="/docs/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> guide to download and 
try Infer yourself. Infer is open-source, so you can also start with the code on the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/Infer">GitHub repo</a>.

Infer is still evolving. 
It is already used within 
Facebook, where it is
deployed and running continuously to verify select properties of every code modification in our mobile apps;
these include the main Facebook apps for Android and iOS, 
Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and other apps which are used by over a billion people in total.
We've come a long way from our
roots in the academic and startup scenes in East London,
but there is much more to do and we feel the best is yet to come.
We
want to continue to develop Infer in the open,
and hope it will be useful for other projects. So 
please try it out, join the community and give us feedback!
